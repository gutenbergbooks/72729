<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 12%">

</div>

<p class="no-indent">The present volume is an attempt to present in a succinct
form the history of an University which, however
uncertain its origin, is among the oldest institutions in
Europe. The result of such a task must needs fall very
far short of perfection, and it is probably a just appreciation
of its difficulties which has deterred abler historians
from undertaking it. The voluminous remains
of Anthony Wood contain a mine of precious records,
but they are singularly ill-arranged, and his narrative
breaks off long before the end of the seventeenth century.
The great monograph of Father Denifle, now in
course of publication, on the early history of European
Universities, promises to be an exhaustive discussion of
its subject; but its enormous bulk and unwieldy construction
will repel most English readers, while it deals
only with the rudimentary development of academical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
constitutions. The well-known compilation of Huber
shows considerable research and grasp of the subject,
but it follows no historical order, and is disfigured by
much irrelevance and prejudice. The publications of
the Oxford Historical Society have already placed documents
hitherto scarcely accessible within the reach of
ordinary students, but it will be long before the series
can be completed. All these works, as well as the
valuable ‘Munimenta Academica’ of Mr. Anstey, Professor
Burrows’ ‘Visitors’ Register,’ and many other
treatises of less note, have been freely consulted by me.
I have also made use of the Merton College Register,
which has been kept with few interruptions since the
year 1482, and of other MSS. documents in the possession
of my own College. But I have not thought it well
to encumber the pages of so compendious a narrative
with constant references to authorities. My principal
aim has been to exhibit the various features and incidents
of University history, age by age, in their due proportion;
dwelling more upon broad and undisputed facts
than upon comparatively obscure points which are the
natural field of antiquarian speculation or criticism.
Guided by a similar principle, I have not treated all
periods of University history with equal detail. Thus, I
have devoted a large share of space to the period of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
Civil Wars, during which the University played a great
part in the national drama; while I have passed lightly
over the reign of George III., when the University had
not only lost all political importance, but had forfeited
its reputation as a place of the highest education and
learning. In the selection of topics from so vast a mass
of materials, I have sought to preserve the continuity
of events, so far as possible, rather than to produce a
series of essays on special aspects of University life. I
have deviated, however, from this method in one or
two instances, such as the chapter on Oxford politics in
the eighteenth century, and that on the Neo-Catholic
Revival. In several of the earlier chapters, and in
those on Oxford in the present century, I have
borrowed the substance of passages from my own
volume, ‘Memorials of Merton College,’ and from articles
on recent University reforms contributed by myself to
various periodicals. If I have succeeded in bringing
within a single view the successive phases of development
through which the University has passed in the
course of seven hundred years, and in paving the way
for a more comprehensive and detailed history, the
object of this little volume will have been attained.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mythical
origin of the
University</div>

<p class="no-indent">The University of Oxford has long ceased to claim the
fabulous antiquity for which its mediæval champions had
contended, as for an article of faith, and which
found credit with so conscientious an historian
as Anthony Wood. It is now admitted that nothing
is certainly known of its origin, and that its alleged
foundation by Alfred the Great rests upon a tradition
which cannot be traced back to a period beyond the
fourteenth century. There is no evidence whatever to
show that any germ of a University, much less that any
college, existed at Oxford in the reign of Alfred, who
was born in the neighbouring town of Wantage. The
very contrary may reasonably be inferred from the
negative fact that Asser, in his contemporary biography
of Alfred, makes no allusion to his supposed institution
of ‘schools’ at Oxford, though he amply attests his
paternal zeal for English education. The early chroniclers
are, without exception, equally silent on the subject,
which is noticed by no extant writer before the age of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
Edward III. In the next reign, the primary myth—for
so we must regard it—was developed into a secondary
myth, attributing to Alfred the foundation of University
College, and this imaginary pretension was actually
advanced by that college in the course of a lawsuit.
Meanwhile, the simpler tradition of Alfred’s connection
with the University Schools was repeated by author
after author in days when the very nature of historical
proof was unknown, and was reinforced in the sixteenth
century by the insertion of a spurious passage into the
work of Asser. It has been reserved for the present
century to recognise the plain truth that we are entirely
ignorant of the first stage in the growth of the University,
and that its name is never mentioned in history
before the Norman Conquest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early
schools of
Oxford</div>

<p>The silence of Domesday Book respecting the University
of Oxford must be taken as presumptive, though
by no means conclusive, proof that it had no
corporate existence at that date. Much learning
has been spent in speculations on its origin and
primitive constitution, but these speculations have little
support in any facts historically known to us before the
Norman Conquest. It is more than probable, however,
that Oxford was already a resort of students and a place
of education. Having been a residence of Edmund
Ironside, Canute, and Harold I., as well as the seat of
several National Councils, it was now recognised as a
provincial capital by the erection of its castle, embracing
within it the Collegiate Church of St. George; while the
number of its monastic establishments would naturally
attract poor scholars from all parts of England. The
earliest schools, not in England only but throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
Europe, were attached to monasteries or cathedrals; and,
in the absence of any contrary evidence, analogy almost
compels us to regard the Church as the foster-mother
of the University. In the ‘claustral’ schools of St.
Frideswide, and the houses in Oxford belonging to
abbeys, such as those of Abingdon and Eynsham, we
may discern the original seminaries of academical teaching—the
first rudiments of the <em>Studium Generale</em>, afterwards
developed into the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Universitas Literaria</i>. On the
other hand, it is certain that, side by side with these
claustral schools, secular or lay schools were gradually
opened—some boarding-schools, mainly designed for the
reception of boys from the country, others mere classrooms
frequented by the students who lodged either in
private dwellings or in public hostels. It appears that
before long the secular outnumbered the claustral
schools, and became centred in a particular quarter of
the city, stretching northward from the west end of St.
Mary’s Church, afterwards known as School Street, and
said to have existed in the year 1109. We may surmise
with some confidence that in the infancy of the University
its lecturers were almost exclusively clerks, but too
often scholastic adventurers of mean attainments, whose
lessons rose little above the barest elements of knowledge.
But all theories of its rudimentary organisation
are purely conjectural. ‘The Schools of Oxford’ first
emerge into history in the next century, when they
really attained a national celebrity, soon eclipsing those
of Canterbury, Winchester, Peterborough, and others,
which may have rivalled them in earlier times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intellectual
revival of
the twelfth
century</div>

<p>The twelfth century, the golden age of feudalism and
the Crusades, was also marked by a notable movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
of thought and revival of speculative activity. The
culture and science which had long found a home at
Cordova now began to diffuse themselves over
Western Europe, and the works of Avicenna
introduced a curious relish for Aristotle’s
‘Natural Philosophy,’ which veiled itself in mysticism to
escape ecclesiastical censure. The old scholastic <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trivium</i>
of grammar, logic, and rhetoric, with the mathematical
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quadrivium</i>, comprising arithmetic, geometry, astronomy,
and music, still constituted the magic circle
of ‘Arts’ in the mediæval sense. But the ‘sciences,’
as they were then called, of physics, Roman law, and
systematic theology, if not medicine, were now claiming
a place in the curriculum of education; and valuable
histories, in the form of chronicles, were compiled in
several English monasteries. That age cannot be called
intellectually barren which produced Lanfranc, Anselm,
Abelard, Bernard, Peter the Lombard, Averroes, Gratian,
and Maimonides. The University of Bologna, with its
School of Law, opened by Irnerius under imperial patronage,
was among the first fruits of this mediæval renaissance.
The cultivation of Roman jurisprudence is
usually dated from the discovery of a copy of the
Pandects at the capture of Amalfi in 1135, but it cannot
have been wholly unknown at an earlier period, since
the religious orders had been forbidden by a Papal
mandate to study it. The lectures of Irnerius, however,
apparently preceding the capture of Amalfi, methodised
and popularised the new learning, which spread rapidly
through Western Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lectures of
Vacarius,
and first
germs of the
University</div>

<p>There is historical evidence of Vacarius, a professor
from Bologna, having commenced lectures in civil law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
at Oxford, under the patronage of Archbishop Theobald,
about 1149, in the reign of Stephen, by whom they
were prohibited for a while at the instance of
teachers interested in philosophy and theology.
This is the earliest well-ascertained event
in the academical life of Oxford, but it may safely be
inferred that if Vacarius came from Italy to lecture in
the schools of Oxford, those schools had already attained
something like a European reputation, and were fitted
to become the germ of an University.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> We have the
positive testimony of John of Salisbury, who had studied
at Paris, that Oxford, just before the accession of
Henry II., was engrossed by logical controversies about
the nature of Universals. Yet this concourse of eager
students apparently possessed no chartered rights.
There is no sufficient ground for the assertion that
Henry I. was educated at Oxford, and granted some
important privileges to the so-called ‘University;’ but we
know that he lived much both at Oxford and at Woodstock,
that he built the palace of Beaumont on the north
of the city, and that he demised to its corporation the fee
farm of the city for the annual rent of sixty-three pounds.
Nor can it be proved, as it has been alleged, that, having
sunk again to a low ebb under Stephen and Henry II.,
it was revived by the judicious patronage of Richard I.,
himself born at Beaumont. On the other hand, starting
from the fact that the Oxford schools attracted a professor
from Italy in the reign of Stephen, we are justified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
in believing that they could scarcely have escaped the
notice of Henry I., who earned a name for scholarship
in that unlettered era, and is said to have ‘pleased himself
much with the conversation of clerks;’ or of Stephen,
who twice held Councils at Oxford; or of Henry II.,
who, like his grandfather, constantly resided in the
immediate neighbourhood. Without the encouragement
of the Crown as well as of the Church, they could not
have attained the position which they clearly occupied
before the end of the twelfth century. By this time
Oseney Abbey had been founded, and had annexed the
church of St. George within the Castle. Both of these
religious houses served as lodgings for young scholars,
who contributed to swell the number of Oxford students.
It is true that we have no trace of academical endowments,
or of royal charters recognising the Oxford
schools, in the twelfth century. But we are informed
on good authority that Robert Pullen (or Pulleyne),
author of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sententiarum Libri Octo</i>, and for some
years a student at Paris, delivered regular courses of
lectures on the Scriptures at Oxford some years before
the visit of Vacarius. More than a generation later, in
the year 1186 or 1187, Giraldus Cambrensis, having
been despatched to Ireland by Henry II. as companion
of Prince John, publicly read at Oxford his work on the
Topography of Ireland. According to his own account,
‘not willing to hide his candle under a bushel, but to
place it on a candlestick, that it might give light to all,
he resolved to read it publicly at Oxford, where the most
learned and famous of the English clergy were at that
time to be found.’ These recitations lasted three successive
days, and the lecturer has left it on record that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
he feasted not only ‘all the doctors of the different
faculties and such of their pupils as were of fame and
note,’ but ‘the rest of the scholars,’ with many burgesses
and even the poor of the city. Whether or not the
schools thus frequented at Oxford were mainly founded
by the Benedictines, as has been maintained, and
whether or not they were mainly conducted by teachers
from Paris, they assuredly existed, and constituted an
University in all but the name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Connection
of Oxford
with the
University
of Paris</div>

<p>It is no longer doubtful that, in their earliest stage,
the schools of Oxford owed much to those of Paris, then
in a far more advanced state of development,
though not formally incorporated into an
‘University’ until early in the thirteenth century.
William of Champeaux had opened a school of
logic at Paris so far back as 1109. His pupil, Abelard,
followed him; and the fame of Abelard himself
was far surpassed by that of Peter Lombard, whose
text-book of ‘Sentences’ became the philosophical
Bible of the Middle Ages. Students flocked in from
all parts of Europe; lectures multiplied, not only in one
faculty, as at Bologna or Salerno, but in every branch
of mediæval study, especially in those comprised under
‘Arts;’ a system of exercises, degrees, academical discipline,
and even college life, was gradually matured;
and when Philip Augustus gave the new academical
guild his royal approval, it was already in a condition
of vigorous activity. In this sense, the growth of the
University of Paris was spontaneous. Like that of
Oxford, it was originally nothing but an association of
teachers united by mutual interest; but, like all
mediæval institutions, it grew up under Church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
authority. It had originally sprung from the cathedral
school of Notre-Dame; the ecclesiastical chancellor of
Paris claimed a paramount jurisdiction over it, which,
however, was constantly resisted by the University, not
without support from the Court of Rome; and the
validity of its highest degrees was derived from the
sanction of the Pope himself. Considering the links
which bound England to France, through Normandy
and her other French provinces, as well as the intellectual
ascendency of Paris over Western Europe, it is
natural that Oxford should have borrowed many features
of her internal regulations from this source, though it
cannot be affirmed with certainty that she did so. The
presumption is strongly confirmed by the undoubted
fact that the ‘English nation’ was one of the four
‘nations’ into which the students of Paris were divided,
the Normans forming another distinct nation by themselves.
Leland tells us that young Englishmen who
then aspired to a high education got their schooling, as
we should call it, at Oxford, but their college training
at Paris, and Anthony Wood gives a list of eminent
Oxonians who had studied at Paris, including the
names of Giraldus Cambrensis, Robert Pulleyne, Robert
Grosteste, Roger Bacon, and Stephen Langton. If
this be so, it was inevitable that, on their return, they
should bring home with them ideas based on their experience
of Paris, which might thus gradually become
a model of academical organisation for Oxford. In the
year 1229, a fresh link of connection with the great
French University was created by a large immigration
of Parisian students. The immediate cause of this
immigration was an outbreak of hostility between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
scholars and citizens of Paris, like those which so constantly
recurred between the same parties at Oxford.
Henry III. had the foresight to seize this opportunity
of reinforcing his own University, and among the many
students who came from Paris to Oxford on his invitation
were several of his own subjects who had gone
abroad for their education.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recognition
of the
scholars by
the Papal
Legate after
the riot of
1209</div>

<p>At all events, at the beginning of the thirteenth
century, we find at Oxford an academical body singularly
like that long established at Paris, and exhibiting
almost equal vitality. In one respect, indeed,
its position was still more independent; for,
whereas at Paris the University was overshadowed
by a Royal Court with all the great
dignitaries of the French Church and State,
at Oxford the University authorities had no competitors
but the corporation of the city. Moreover, while at
Paris there was a resident chancellor of Notre-Dame,
ever ready to assert his authority, there was no episcopal
see of Oxford; the diocesan lived at a safe distance,
and the archdeacon was the highest resident functionary
of the Church. About the beginning of the
thirteenth century, Edmund Rich, afterwards archbishop
of Canterbury, and Robert Grosteste, afterwards
bishop of Lincoln, became pioneers of Aristotelian study
in Oxford, and were among the earliest graduates in
divinity, a faculty then in its infancy. In the year
1214 we come upon more solid ground in a documentary
record preserved in the archives of the University. This
record, in the shape of a letter from the Papal Legate,
refers to an important incident which had occurred five
years before, in 1209, when three students had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
seized and hanged by a mob of townspeople, with the
mayor and burgesses at their head, in revenge for the
death of a woman accidentally killed by another student.
In consequence of this outrage, said to have been countenanced
by King John, the city was laid under an
interdict by the Pope, who issued a prohibition against
lecturing in Oxford, and the great body of students
migrated to Cambridge, Reading, or elsewhere. The
letter of the Papal Legate, reciting the submission of
the burgesses to his authority, and his disposition to
deal mercifully with them, proceeds to impose upon
them certain penalties. One of these is the remission
of half the fixed rent payable for halls tenanted by
scholars, for a period of ten years. Another is the payment
of fifty-two shillings yearly for the support of poor
scholars, and the obligation to feast one hundred poor
scholars every year on St. Nicholas’s Day. They are
also to swear that, in future, they will furnish the
scholars with provisions at a just and reasonable price;
and that if they shall arrest a clerk they shall deliver
him up, upon due requisition from the bishop of Lincoln
or the archdeacon of Oxford, or his official, or the
chancellor, or ‘him whom the bishop of Lincoln shall
have deputed to this office.’ This oath is to be repeated
yearly. All masters who continued to lecture after the
retirement of scholars under Papal mandate are to be
suspended from lecturing for three years. All townsmen
convicted of participation in the original crime are
to come, without shoes, hats, or cloaks, to the graves of
the murdered ‘clerks,’ and are to give their bodies
proper burial in a place to be solemnly chosen. Upon
any default in the fulfilment of these conditions, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
former sentence of excommunication is again to be
enforced by the bishop of Lincoln.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Office of
chancellor</div>

<p>It is to be observed that in this memorable document
there is no mention of an ‘University.’ The members
of the academical fraternity are called
simply ‘clerks’ or ‘scholars studying at
Oxford.’ It may further be inferred from the expressions
respecting the chancellor, that no chancellor of
the University existed distinct from the chancellor
of the diocese, or, at least, that, if he existed, he was
a nominee of the bishop of Lincoln. On the other
hand, the scholars are recognised throughout as under
the special protection of the Papal See, as well as
under special jurisdiction of the bishop of Lincoln,
afterwards to become <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex officio</i> Visitor of the University.
It seems to follow that, while the University,
as a corporation, was not yet fully constituted, such a
corporation already existed in an inchoate state, and
the schools of Oxford enjoyed a privileged status at the
supreme court of Western Christendom. When they
first became, in the legal sense, an ‘University’ under
a chancellor of their own, is still a disputed question,
though a seal has been engraved, supposed to be of
about the year 1200, which bears the inscription, ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sigillum
Cancellarii et Universitatis Oxoniensis</i>.’ Much
learning has been expended on the origin of the chancellorship,
and it will probably never be determined with
certainty whether the earliest chancellors derived their
authority exclusively from the bishop of Lincoln as
diocesan, or were in the nature of elective rectors of
the schools (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rectores Scholarum</i>), whose election was
confirmed by the bishop of Lincoln. What is certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
is that the acting head of the University was always
entitled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cancellarius</i> rather than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rector Scholarum</i>, that
from the beginning of Henry III.’s reign he is frequently
mentioned under this official title, especially in
the important charters of 1244 and 1255, and that by
the middle of the thirteenth century he was treated as
an independent representative of the University, while
the official deputy of the bishop at the University was
not the chancellor but the archdeacon of Oxford. At
this period, then, we may regard the University as fully
constituted, and the official list of chancellors begins in
the year 1220, when three persons are mentioned as
having filled the office, the last of whom is Robert
Grosteste, afterwards the celebrated reforming bishop
of Lincoln. From this epoch we may safely date the
election of the chancellor by Convocation, though it
long continued to be subject to confirmation by the
diocesan. A century later (1322) the election was
made biennial.</p>

<div class="sidenote">University
chests, and
sources of
revenue in
the thirteenth
century.
Rise
of Halls</div>

<p>In the year 1219 the abbot and Convent of Eynsham
took upon themselves the obligations laid upon
the burgesses in 1214, so far as regarded the
double provision for poor scholars. This agreement
was carried out, yet the burgesses are
still treated as liable in an ordinance issued,
in 1240, by Robert Grosteste, then bishop of
Lincoln, which provides for the regular application of
the fund to its original purpose. This ordinance marks
an important epoch in the growth of the University.
The ‘Frideswyde Chest,’ and other chests formed on a
like principle by successive benefactions for the relief of
poor scholars, appear to have been the earliest form of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
corporate property held by the University. They continued
to multiply up to the end of the fifteenth century,
when they had reached the number of twenty-four
at least, and are computed to have contained an aggregate
sum of 2,000 marks, all of which might be in
circulation on loan at the same time.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is very difficult
to ascertain what other sources of revenue the University
may have possessed in the first stage of its existence.
In the next stage, its income seems to have been largely
derived from academical fines and fees on graces, as well
as from duties paid by masters keeping grammar-schools
and principals of halls, into which the primitive
boarding-schools were first transforming themselves.
It is clear that, at this period, the great mass of
students, not being inmates of religious houses, were
lodged and boarded in these unendowed halls, mostly
hired from the citizens by clerks, who in some cases
were not even graduates, but were regularly licensed
by the chancellor or his commissary on September 9,
and were subject to fixed rules of discipline laid down
from time to time by the governing body of the University.
How many of them may have been open in
the middle of the thirteenth century is a question which
cannot be answered. About seventy are specified by
name in a list compiled nearly two centuries later, but we
have no means of knowing how many ancient halls may
have then become extinct, or how many new halls may
have been founded. The evidence now in our possession
does not enable us to identify more than about eighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
as having ever existed, and it is certain that all these
did not exist at any one time. Even if we suppose that
several hundred students were housed in monastic
buildings during the age preceding the foundation of
colleges, and make a large allowance for those in private
lodging-houses, we cannot estimate the whole number
of University scholars at more than 2,000, or at the
most 3,000. The loose statement of Richard of Armagh,
so lightly repeated by Anthony Wood and others, that
some 30,000 scholars were collected at Oxford in this
age, not only rests upon no sure historical ground, but
is utterly inconsistent with all that we know of the
area covered by the city, and of the position occupied
by the academical population.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early
University
charters</div>

<p>It is well known that Henry III. frequently visited
Oxford for the purpose of holding councils or otherwise,
and his relations with the University were
constant. Amongst the letters and charters
issued by him in regard to University affairs three are
specially notable. One of these letters, dated 1238,
was addressed to the mayor and burghers, directing
them to inquire into the circumstances of a riot at
Oseney Abbey between the servants of Otho, the Papal
Legate, and a body of disorderly students. This riot
led to a struggle, lasting a whole year, between the
Legate and the University, supported by the English
bishops, and especially by Robert Grosteste. The Legate
was ultimately appeased by the public submission of
the University representatives in London to his authority,
whereupon he withdrew the interdict which he had
laid upon the Oxford clerks, some of whom had retired
to Northampton, and others, it is said, to Salisbury.
Meanwhile the conflicts between the students and
townspeople were incessant. In 1244, after a violent
attack of gownsmen on the Jewry, the chancellor of
the University was given by a royal writ exclusive
cognisance of all pleas arising out of contracts relating
to personalty, and in 1248 the ‘mayor’s oath’ of
fidelity to the privileges of the University was imposed
by letters patent. By a similar charter, granted in
1255 to the city of Oxford, these privileges are incidentally
confirmed, for it is there provided that if a
‘clerk’ shall injure a townsman he shall be imprisoned
until the chancellor shall claim him, while, if a townsman
shall injure a clerk, he shall be imprisoned until
he make satisfaction according to the judgment of the
chancellor. Two years later (in 1257) the liberties
of the University were defended against the bishop of
Lincoln himself before the king at St. Albans, on the
ground that Oxford was, after Paris, ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">schola secunda
ecclesiæ</i>.’</p>

<span class="fs80">THE EARLY COLLEGES.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Rise of
Colleges</div>

<p class="no-indent">By far the most important event in the academical
history of the thirteenth century was the foundation of
University, Balliol, and Merton Colleges. The
idea of secular colleges, it is true, was not
wholly new. Harold’s foundation at Waltham, afterwards
converted into an abbey, was originally non-monastic,
and designed to be a home for secular priests, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
it was not an educational institution. There were
colleges for the maintenance of poor scholars at Bologna;
rather, however, in the nature of the Oxford
halls. If the founders of the earliest Oxford college
were indebted for their inspiration to any foreign
source, they must have derived it from the great French
University in Paris, of which the collegiate system
already formed a distinctive feature. Not to speak of
still more ancient colleges at Paris, either attached to
monasteries or serving the purpose of mere lodging-houses,
the Sorbonne, founded about 1250, furnishes a
striking precedent for its Oxford successors, as an
academical cloister specially planned for the education
of the secular clergy. Nevertheless, there is no proof
that its constitution was actually imitated or studied by
the founder of any Oxford college, and there is one
important difference between the Paris and Oxford
colleges, that whereas the former were appropriated
to special faculties, the latter welcomed students in
all faculties. It is, therefore, by no means improbable
that in the development of the college system,
as in the original incorporation of schools into an
academical body, like causes produced like results by
independent processes at the French and English
Universities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foundation
of University
and
Balliol</div>

<p>The claim of University College to priority among
Oxford colleges cannot be disputed, if the foundation of a
college is to be dated from the earliest of the endowments
afterwards appropriated to its support. It
was in 1249 that William of Durham left by will a
sum of 310 marks to the University of Oxford for the
maintenance of ten or more Masters, being natives of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
the county of Durham, in lodgings to be provided at
Oxford out of this fund. Two houses in School Street,
Oxford, and one in High Street, were purchased
by the University before 1263, and
were probably occupied by students. There
was, however, no royal charter of incorporation, no provision
for corporate self-government, or for the succession
of fellows, no organised society, no distribution
of powers or definition of duties. In a word, the institution
founded by William of Durham was not a
college, but an exhibition-fund to be administered by
the University. It was not until 1292 that this
scattered body of exhibitioners was consolidated into
‘the Great Hall of the University,’ as it was then
called, under statutes which are a very meagre copy of
those issued nearly thirty years earlier by Walter de
Merton, and which, unlike his, were imposed, not by
the founder, but by the University itself. Meanwhile,
at some time between 1263 and 1268, John Balliol, of
Barnard Castle, father of John Balliol, king of Scotland,
provided similar exhibitions for poor scholars
at Oxford. His intention was completed by his wife,
Dervorguilla, who collected the recipients of his bounty
into a single building on the present site of the college,
increased the endowments so that it might support a
body of sixteen exhibitioners with a yearly stipend of
twenty-seven marks apiece, and in 1282 issued statutes
regulating the new foundation, but fully conceding the
principle of self-government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foundation
of Merton
College</div>

<p>In the meantime Merton College had been founded
on a far larger scale, and had received statutes which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
viewed across the interval of six centuries, astonish
us by their comprehensive wisdom and foresight. As an
institution for the promotion of academical
education under collegiate discipline but secular
guidance, it was the expression of a conception
entirely new in England, which deserves special consideration,
inasmuch as it became the model of all
other collegiate foundations, and determined the future
constitution of both the English Universities. In this
sense, Merton College is entitled to something more
than precedence, for its founder was the real founder of
the English college-system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Merton
College,
Statutes of,
1274</div>

<p>The oldest foundation charter of Merton College,
issued in 1264, was itself the development of still earlier
schemes for the support of poor scholars, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in scholis
degentes</i>. It established an endowed ‘House
of the scholars of Merton’ at Malden, in Surrey,
under a warden or bailiffs, with two or three ‘ministers
of the altar.’ Out of the estates assigned to this collegiate
house were to be maintained a body of twenty
students in a hall or lodging at Oxford, or elsewhere, if
a more flourishing <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">studium generale</i> should elsewhere be
instituted. In 1274, Walter de Merton, having greatly
expanded his first design, put forth his final statutes,
transferring the warden, bailiffs, and ministers of the
altar, from Malden to Oxford, and designating Oxford
as the exclusive and permanent home of the scholars.
These statutes, which continued in force until the year
1856, are a marvellous repertory of minute and elaborate
provisions governing every detail of college life.
The number and allowances of the scholars; their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
studies, diet, costume, and discipline; the qualifications,
election, and functions of the warden; the distribution
of powers among various college officers; the management
of the college estates, and the conduct of college
business, are here regulated with truly remarkable
sagacity. The policy which dictated and underlies them
is easy to discern. Fully appreciating the intellectual
movement of his age, and unwilling to see the paramount
control of it in the hands of the religious orders—the
zealous apostles of Papal supremacy—Walter de
Merton resolved to establish within the precincts of
the University a great seminary of secular clergy, which
should educate a succession of men capable of doing
good service in Church and State. He was not content
with a copy or even a mere adaptation of the monastic
idea; on the contrary, it may be surmised that he was
influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the spirit of
those non-monastic institutions, now almost forgotten,
in which the parochial clergy of an earlier age had
sometimes lived together under a common rule. The
employment of his scholars was to be study—not the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">claustralis religio</i> of the older religious orders, nor
the more practical and popular self-devotion of the
Dominicans and Franciscans. He forbade them ever to
take vows; he enjoined them to maintain their corporate
independence against all foreign encroachments; he
ordained that all should apply themselves to studying
the liberal arts and philosophy before entering upon a
course of theology; and he provided special chaplains
to relieve them of ritual and ceremonial duties. He
contemplated and even encouraged their going forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
into the great world, only reminding those who might
win an ample fortune (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">uberior fortuna</i>) to show their
gratitude by advancing the interests of the college.
No ascetic obligations were laid upon them, but residence
and continuous study were strictly prescribed,
and if any scholars retired from the college with the
intention of giving up learning, or even ceased to study
diligently, their salaries were no longer to be paid. If
the scale of these salaries and statutable allowances was
humble, it was chiefly because the founder intended
the number of his scholars to be constantly increased,
as the revenues of the house might be enlarged. He
even recognised the duty of meeting the needs of future
ages, and empowered his scholars not only to make new
statutes, but even to migrate elsewhere from Oxford in
case of necessity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Social
position,
manners,
and
academical
life of early
students</div>

<p>If we seek to measure the effect produced by the
rise of colleges on the character of the University, we
must endeavour to realise the aspect of University
life and manners before colleges were
planted in Oxford. The students, as we have
seen, were lodged in religious houses, licensed
halls, or private chambers. The former were mostly
destined to swell the ranks of the regular clergy, and,
it may be presumed, were subjected to some wholesome
rules of discipline, independent of any authority exercised
by the University. As they also received the
whole or the greater part of their instruction within the
walls of their convents, they probably were rarely seen
in the streets, cultivated a certain degree of refinement,
and took comparatively little part in the riots which
constantly disturbed the peace of Oxford in the Middle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Ages. With the other two classes it was far otherwise.
Even the inmates of halls lived in a style and under
conditions which, in our own age, would be regarded
as barbarism. Like other scholars, they were chiefly
drawn from a social grade below that of esquires or
wealthy merchants. Many of them were the less
vigorous members of yeomen’s or tradesmen’s families;
not a few sprang from the very lowest ranks, and actually
begged their way to Oxford. The majority had probably
come as mere schoolboys, at the age of eleven or
twelve, to one of the numerous grammar-schools which
prepared their pupils for the higher studies taught in
the ‘Schools of Oxford’ properly so called. It was for
these younger scholars, we may suppose, that regular
‘fetchers’ and ‘bringers’ were licensed by the University,
as we learn from a document of 1459, though some
were attended by private servants. The older scholars,
however, doubtless travelled in parties, for the sake of
protection and economy, with their scanty baggage
slung over the backs of pack-horses. Having safely
arrived in Oxford, they would disperse to their several
halls; and it does not appear that, at this period, a freshman
underwent any process of matriculation or took any
oath before acquiring the privileges of the University. He
would, of course, share his bedroom, if not his bed, with
others, and be content with the roughest fare, but he
must also have dispensed with nearly all the manifold
aids to study now enjoyed by the humblest students.
Books existed only in the form of costly manuscripts
treasured up in the chilly reading-rooms of monasteries;
privacy was as impossible by day as by night; and the
only chance of acquiring knowledge was by hanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
upon the lips of a teacher lecturing to a mixed class of
all ages and infinitely various attainments, in an ill-lighted
room, unprovided with desks or fireplace, which
in these days would be condemned as utterly unfit for an
elementary school-room. The principal of his hall, it is
true, was supposed to be his tutor, but we have positive
evidence, in a statute of 1432, that principals themselves
were sometimes illiterate persons, and of doubtful
character; nor was it until that year that it was necessary
for them to be graduates. What kind of language
he would hear, and what kind of habits he would learn,
from his chamber-mates and class-mates in the century
preceding the age of Chaucer, we can be at no loss to
imagine. And yet the inmate of a hall, being under
some kind of domestic superintendence, was a model
of academical propriety compared with the unattached
students, or ‘chamber-dekyns,’ whose enormities
fill so large a space in the mediæval annals of the
University.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Chamber-dekyns’</div>

<p>It is possible that a certain jealousy on the part
of principals and others personally interested in the
prosperity of halls may have exaggerated the
vices of these extra-aularian students. At the
same time it is self-evident that raw youths congregated
together, under no authority, in the houses of townspeople,
or ‘laymen,’ would be far more likely to be
riotous and disorderly than members of halls, or, still
more, of colleges. Accordingly, the ‘chamber-dekyns’
were always credited with the chief share in the street
brawls and other excesses which so often disgraced the
University in the Middle Ages. The leading statute
on the subject, it is true, was passed in the year 1432,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
when colleges and halls had already established a decisive
ascendency, and when the ‘chamber-dekyns’
may have sunk into greater contempt than in earlier
times. But that statute, abolishing the system of
lodging in private houses, treats its abuses as of long
standing, and probably describes a state of things which
had existed for two centuries. It is here recited that
the peace of the University is constantly disturbed by
persons who, having the appearance of scholars, dwell
in no hall and are subject to no principal, but lurk
about the town in taverns and brothels, committing
murders and thefts; wherefore it is ordained that all
scholars must reside in some college or hall, under
pain of imprisonment, and that no townsman shall
harbour scholars without special leave from the chancellor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Street
brawls and
disorders</div>

<p>The reality of the evils against which this statute
was aimed is attested by the frequent recurrence of
other statutes against crimes of violence committed
by scholars, as well as by college rules
against frequenting the streets except under proper
control. We may take as an example an University
statute passed in 1432 against ‘the unbridled prevalence
of execrable disturbances’ in Oxford, which specifically
imposes fines, on a graduated scale, for threats of personal
violence, carrying weapons, pushing with the
shoulder or striking with the fist, striking with a stone
or club, striking with a knife, dagger, sword, axe, or
other warlike weapon, carrying bows and arrows, gathering
armed men, and resisting the execution of justice,
especially by night. The main cause of these brawls
is clearly indicated by the further injunction that no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
scholar or Master shall take part with another because
he is of the same country, or against him because he is
of a different country. The statutable fines range from
one shilling to no less than forty—a highly deterrent
penalty in the reign of Henry VI. It is to be observed
that while the parade of arms within the chancellor’s
jurisdiction is prohibited, the possession of them is
rather taken for granted, since they were usually carried
for purposes of defence on long journeys. Bows and
arrows, as essentially offensive weapons, are naturally
placed under a stricter ban, and the heaviest punishment
is properly reserved for riotous assemblages, which
had so often led to bloodshed in the streets of mediæval
Oxford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superiority
of colleges
in discipline
and tuition</div>

<p>In such a state of society colleges offered not only a
tranquil retreat to adult scholars, but also a safe and
well-regulated home to younger students attending
courses of lectures in the schools.
The early founders, it is true, did not design
them to be mainly educational seminaries for the general
youth of the country, and probably expected their
inmates to obtain much of their instruction outside the
walls of the college. But the statutes of Merton prove
conclusively that ‘Scholars’<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> on admission were supposed
to be of about the same age as modern freshmen, and to
need rudimentary teaching, while express provision was
made for the reception of mere schoolboys. Doubtless,
for at least two centuries after the institution of colleges,
their members were greatly outnumbered by those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
halls, and the system which in the fifteenth century
triumphed over the rivalry of private hostels may be
more properly called aularian than collegiate. Nevertheless,
the superiority of colleges as boarding-houses
for students inevitably made itself felt from the very
first. Humble as their buildings and domestic arrangements
may originally have been, they were imposing
and luxurious by contrast with those of lodging-houses
or halls. Their endowments enabled them to maintain
a standard of decency and comfort in itself conducive to
study; their statutes ensured regularity of discipline;
their corporate privileges and rights of self-government
imparted a dignity and security to all connected with
them; the example and authority of their elder fellows,
mostly engaged in scholastic or scientific research, if
not in vigorous lecturing, cannot have been wholly lost
upon the juniors. In Merton, and probably in other
colleges, disputations were carried on as in the University
schools; attendance at Divine service was a statutable
obligation; students were not allowed to go about
the streets unless accompanied by a Master of Arts; in
the dormitories the seniors were invested with a kind of
monitorial authority over the rest; and misconduct was
punishable with expulsion. By degrees, some of the
halls came into the possession and under the control of
colleges, which might naturally elect the most promising
of their inmates to scholarships. No wonder that,
however weak numerically, the seven colleges founded
before the end of the fourteenth century produced an
immense proportion of the men who adorned that age
by their learning and virtues.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Thus, out of eighteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
vice-chancellors who can be identified as having filled
that office in the fourteenth century, five at least were
members of Merton College, two of Oriel, and one of
Queen’s. Of sixty-four proctors known to have been
elected during the same century, twenty-two at least
were members of Merton, eight of Oriel, four of Balliol,
and one of University, Exeter, Queen’s, and New
College respectively, while it is probable that others, of
whom nothing definite is known, really belonged to one
of the seven ancient colleges. Considering how largely
the non-collegiate population of the University outnumbered
these small collegiate bodies, it is a very
significant fact that so many vice-chancellors and
proctors should have been chosen from them in days
when election to both these offices was entirely free.
Such a fact goes far to prove that the ‘college monopoly,’
of which so much has been heard in later times, owed
its origin, in a great degree, to natural selection in a
genuine struggle for existence between endowed and
unendowed societies.</p>

<span class="fs80">PROGRESS OF THE UNIVERSITY IN THE FOURTEENTH
CENTURY.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Europe in the
fourteenth
century</div>

<p class="no-indent">The fourteenth century deserves to be regarded as the
most progressive and eventful in the history of the
Middle Ages. All the kingdoms of Europe
were engaged in wars, for the most part destitute
of permanent results, yet the work of civilisation
went forward with unbroken steadiness and rapidity.
The Spanish monarchies of Castile and Arragon continued
their long struggle for supremacy with each
other, and for national existence with the Mohammedan
power at Granada. Germany was distracted by civil
wars and double imperial elections; Italy was torn
asunder by the factions of the Guelphs and Ghibellines.
The usurpation and avarice of the Roman Court produced
an all but general revolt against Papal authority;
the seat of the Holy See was transferred for sixty years
to Avignon, and the return of the Pope to Rome was
followed by ‘the Great Schism,’ which lasted fifty years
longer; Russia was subject to the Khan of Kipchak
until its southern provinces were overrun by the hordes
of Timur; Poland and Hungary were exhausting their
strength in expeditions against their neighbours or
against Venice, while the Ottoman Turks were advancing
into the heart of Eastern Europe. England was entering
upon its purely dynastic crusades for the possession of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
the Scotch and French crowns, which, fruitful as they
were in military glory, diverted the energies of the
nation, wasted its resources, and retarded its internal
development for several generations. Nevertheless,
literature, art, and education flourished marvellously
in the midst of the storms which racked European
society. Ancient learning was revived in Italy chiefly
by the influence of Petrarch and Boccaccio; Dante
became the father of modern Italian poetry; Cimabue
and his pupils founded the Italian school of painting;
scholastic philosophy culminated and gave place to a
more independent spirit of inquiry; scientific research
first began to emancipate itself from magical arts;
Roman law extended its dominion everywhere except
in England, where, however, Chaucer and Wyclif gave
the first powerful impulse to native English thought;
free thinking in politics and religion penetrated deeply
into the popular mind, and increasing refinement of
manners kept pace with the growth of trade and
industry. Universities sprang up one after another—in
France, in Spain, in Italy, in Poland, in Hungary,
in Austria, and in Germany; nor is it unduly rash to
surmise that, if the invention of printing could have
been anticipated by a century, the Renaissance and the
Reformation itself might have preceded the capture of
Constantinople and the discovery of America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Social condition
of the
University</div>

<p>At the commencement of this century Oxford presented
strange contrasts between the social and the
intellectual aspects of its academical life. The
great riot of 1297 was scarcely over, and had
left a heritage of ill-will which bore fruit in the frightful
conflict of 1354; the encounters between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
northern and southern nations were of frequent recurrence,
and there was no effective system of University
discipline, while college discipline, still in its infancy,
was confined within the precincts of Merton, University,
and Balliol. The common herd of students, inmates
of halls and inns and lodging-houses, were still crowded
together in miserable sleeping-rooms and lecture-rooms,
without domestic care or comfort, and strangers to all
those frank and generous relations which naturally grow
up between young Englishmen, especially of gentle birth,
in the kindly intercourse of modern college life. They
often rendered more or less menial services in return for
their instruction, and were sometimes enabled to borrow
from the University Chest; at other times they
relapsed into mendicity, and asked for alms on the
public highways. There were no libraries or museums,
and the few books possessed by the University were
stored in a vault under St. Mary’s Church. The laws
of health being unknown, and every sanitary precaution
neglected, the city of Oxford was constantly scourged
with pestilence from which members of the University
were fain to fly into neighbouring country villages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intellectual
vigour of the
University</div>

<p>Under such conditions, and in such a society, it was
utterly impossible that education or learning could
flourish generally according to our modern
ideas, and yet it is certain that a restless and
even feverish activity of speculation prevailed within an
inner circle of philosophical spirits, to which there are
few parallels in the history of thought. If their treasury
of knowledge was scanty in the extreme, yet the range
of their studies was truly sublime, both in its aims
and in its orbit. In the chilly squalor of uncarpeted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
and unwarmed chambers, by the light of narrow and
unglazed casements, or the gleam of flickering oil lamps,
poring over dusky manuscripts hardly to be deciphered
by modern eyesight, undisturbed by the boisterous din
of riot and revelry without, men of humble birth, and
dependent on charity for bare subsistence, but with a
noble self-confidence transcending that of Bacon or of
Newton, thought out and copied out those subtle masterpieces
of mediæval lore, purporting to unveil the hidden
laws of Nature as well as the dark counsels of Providence
and the secrets of human destiny, which—frivolous
and baseless as they may appear under the scrutiny of a
later criticism—must still be ranked among the grandest
achievements of speculative reason. We must remember
that archery and other outdoor sports were then mostly
in the nature of martial exercises reserved for the warlike
classes, while music and the fine arts were all but
unknown, and the sedentary labour of the student was
relieved neither by the athletic nor by the æsthetic
pastimes of our own more favoured age. Thus driven inward
upon itself, the fire of intellectual ambition burned
with a tenfold intensity, and it was tempered by no such
humility as the infinite range of modern science imposes
on the boldest of its disciples. In many a nightly
vigil, and in many a lonely ramble over the wild hill-sides
beyond Cowley and Hincksey, or along the river-sides
between Godstow and Iffley, these pioneers of philosophical
research, to whom alchemy was chemistry, and
astronomy but the key to astrology, constantly pursued
their hopeless quest of Wisdom as it was dimly conceived
by the patriarch Job, pressing Aristotle into the service
of mediæval theology, which they regarded as the science<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
of sciences, and inventing a mysterious phraseology
which to us has lost its meaning, but which they mistook
for solid knowledge, fondly imagining that it might
lead them upward to some primary law governing the
whole realm of matter and of mind. They failed,
indeed, because success was hopeless, but their very
failure paved the way for the ‘new knowledge’ of the
next century, and cleared the ground for the methods
and discoveries which have made other names immortal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foundation
of Exeter,
Oriel,
Queen’s, and
Canterbury
Colleges</div>

<p>During the reigns of Edward II. and Edward III.
the collegiate element in the University was strengthened
by the foundation of five new colleges, one of
which has since become extinct. The first of
these was Exeter College, founded in 1314 by
Walter de Stapledon, bishop of Exeter. Ten
years later, in 1324, Adam de Brome, almoner of King
Edward II., procured from that king a charter of incorporation
for a college, to be called St. Mary’s House,
and to consist of a rector and scholars in divers sciences.
In the following year, having purchased the site of the
present college, now called Oriel, he transferred it to
the king, who, by a fresh charter, erected there a collegiate
society of ten scholars for the study of divinity.
Queens College was founded upon a similar model,
and under similar conditions, in the year 1340, by
Robert de Egglesfield, chaplain to Queen Philippa.
The rules of study and discipline for Oriel and Queen’s
were mostly borrowed from those of Merton, but
some interesting peculiarities may be found in the
Queen’s statutes. The removal of the University from
Oxford is distinctly contemplated, but, on the other hand,
able men are to be welcomed as scholars from all parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
of the world, though a preference is reserved for applicants
from Cumberland and Westmoreland, the founder’s
native county, on account of its recent devastation in
border-warfare. The securities for impartial election to
fellowships are unusually minute, and there is a great
variety of regulations strongly tinged with the mystical
tendency of the founder’s own mind. Canterbury College,
founded by Archbishop Simon Islip in 1361,
differed from these in its original constitution, since it
embraced both secular and ‘religious’ students, and was
mainly designed to promote the study of the civil and
canon law. Two years later, however, this design was
abandoned, and the college was appropriated to secular
priests only, when John Wyclif, probably the Reformer,
was appointed its first head; but he was removed by
Archbishop Langham, and the college became a
monastic nursery under the priory of Canterbury, until
it was absorbed into Christ Church in the reign of
Henry VIII.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foundation
of New
College</div>

<p>The foundation of New College by William of
Wykeham, bishop of Winchester, in 1379, has been
held to mark a new departure in collegiate
history. Like Walter de Merton, William of
Wykeham had filled various high offices of State,
including that of chancellor, and is well known as
the designer of several great architectural works. His
main object in founding the College of ‘St. Mary
of Winchester in Oxford,’ since known as New College,
is clearly stated in his charter. It was to repair ‘the
scarcity of scholars in the nation, having been swept
away by great pestilences and wars.’ Accordingly, in
1379, he obtained a license from Richard II. to found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
a college ‘for seventy scholars studying in the faculties,’
all of whom were to have passed through his other
college for boys at Winchester itself. These scholars
were to be ‘poor indigent clerks,’ sufficiently taught in
grammar, and under twenty years of age. Ten were to
study civil and ten canon law; the remaining fifty were
to study the Arts, or philosophy and theology, though
two of these might be specially permitted to devote
themselves to astronomy, and two to medicine. But
the claim of William of Wykeham to be considered the
second founder of the college-system depends less on
any notable peculiarity in his statutes than on the
grandeur and regularity of the buildings which he
erected on a site then vacant, and found by a jury to be
infested by malefactors, murderers, and thieves, as well
as the scene of other public nuisances. The noble
quadrangle, of which the scholars took possession on the
14th of April, 1386, having already been lodged in
Hert Hall and other tenements, doubtless served as the
model for all the later colleges, and the supremacy of
colleges over halls may fitly be dated from the end of
the fourteenth century, when New College was the most
imposing centre of collegiate life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">European
influence of
Oxford in
the
fourteenth
century</div>

<p>The importance of Oxford in the eyes of Europe was
increased during the fourteenth century by two causes,
the decline of the University of Paris, and the
vigorous protest of Oxford schoolmen against
the spiritual despotism of the Papacy, discredited
by its subjection to French influence
at Avignon. The former of these causes was, in fact,
nearly connected with the latter. The University of
Paris had owed much to Papal encouragement and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
protection, but it had always struggled for corporate
independence, and when, in 1316, it stooped to solicit
the patronage of John XXII., by submitting to him a
list of candidates for preferment, it forfeited its unique
position in the estimation of European scholars, then a
small but united brotherhood. On the other hand, it
was an English Franciscan of Oxford—William of
Occham—who not only challenged the supremacy of the
Pope, but ‘proclaimed the severance of logic from
theology.’ The assertion of this bold paradox, aggravated
by the aggressive Nominalism of its author,
nearly cost him his life, for he was imprisoned by the
Pope’s order at Avignon, and only escaped death by
taking refuge at Munich with the Emperor Louis of
Bavaria. His doctrines, however, found wide acceptance
at Oxford, and paved the way for the far deeper revolution
in ideas of which John Wyclif was the pioneer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rise of
Wyclif</div>

<p>The biography of this remarkable man, if authentic
materials for it existed, would cover almost the whole
academical history of Oxford during the latter
part of the fourteenth century. Unfortunately,
many of the facts are still involved in uncertainty.
Like Duns Scotus, he is believed to have been a
Northerner, though his birthplace is doubtful; like him,
too, he was at once a Realist in metaphysics and a
champion of liberty in theology. Several colleges have
claimed him as their own; Balliol has enrolled him
among its Masters, Queen’s among its commoners, and
Merton among its fellows. His name only appears in
the books of Merton in the year 1356, and though he
soon afterwards took an active part in the controversies
of the day at Balliol and elsewhere, it was not until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
after 1374 that he became known as the founder of a
new school in theology, and, still more, as a dauntless
assailant of the corruptions incident to Papal supremacy
and priestly authority. In asserting the right of private
judgment and exposing ecclesiastical abuses, he was a
true successor of Occham, but he dissented from
Occham’s Nominalism; his sympathies were entirely
with the secular clergy; and, whereas Occham was a
Franciscan, Wyclif inveighed against all the monastic
Orders, but especially against the friars. The movement
which he led was essentially academical in its
origin, and definitely marks a great academical reaction
against the regular clergy, to whose influence learning
and education had owed so much in the previous century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Career of
Wyclif</div>

<p>The career of Wyclif, indeed, belongs to the University
quite as much as to the Church. It was as the
last of the Oxford schoolmen, and mostly from
Oxford itself, that he put forth his series of
books and pamphlets on the relations of Church and
State, on the subjection of the clergy to civil rule, civil
taxation and civil tribunals, on pardons, indulgences,
the worship of saints, transubstantiation, the supremacy
of Holy Scripture, and other like topics, besides those
abstruse scholastic themes which have lost their interest
for the present age. During his earlier struggles, the
open patronage of John of Gaunt, with the occasional
protection of the Court, stood him in good stead, and
enabled him to brave not only episcopal censures but
Papal anathemas. His real strength, however, consisted
in the influence which he commanded in the University
itself and, through it, in the English people. When
Pope Gregory XI. despatched a Bull to the University<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
of Oxford, calling for an inquiry into his erroneous
doctrines, the University barely consented to receive it,
and took no steps to comply with it, though it was
supported by similar Bulls addressed to the King and
the English Bishops. When he was cited for the second
time to answer for his opinions in London, the citizens
were his avowed partisans. When his tenets had become
discredited among the aristocratic party by their
supposed connection with the Peasant Revolt, and were
officially denounced, in 1381, by the Chancellor of the
University, sitting with twelve doctors as assessors,
his cause was, nevertheless, stoutly maintained by
his followers at Oxford. The next Chancellor, Robert
Rygge, of Merton, was at heart among his adherents,
and informed the Archbishop Courtenay, in answer to
a mandate requiring him to search all the colleges and
halls for Wycliffites, that it was as much as his life was
worth. The injunctions of the Archbishop, like those
of his predecessor, were practically defied at Oxford,
until the Crown at last entered the lists against the
Reformer. In 1382, a Parliament was held at Oxford.
The Convocation which accompanied it condemned
Wyclif’s teaching on the Eucharist; the condemnation
was published in the school of the Augustinian monks,
where Wyclif himself was presiding as professor, and a
peremptory order was issued for his expulsion with all
his disciples. He died in 1384, but not before he had
completed his English translation of the Bible. The
spirit which he had kindled continued to animate the
University for many years after his death. In Merton
College alone several eminent fellows were known as
Wycliffites in the next generation, and after the condemnation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
of Lollardism by the Council of London in
1411, it was thought necessary to pass a stringent
University statute to check the propagation of Lollard
doctrines. By this statute, the penalty of the greater
excommunication was imposed upon all who should
disseminate Lollardism, candidates for degrees were required
to abjure it, and heads of colleges or halls were
enjoined to exclude from their societies any person even
suspected of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feud
between
Northern
and Southern
‘nations’</div>

<p>While the University was agitated by these philosophical
and theological storms, its external life seems
to have been comparatively uneventful during
the fourteenth century. We read, however, of
a brutal faction fight between ‘the Northern
and Southern clerks’ in 1319, and this ancient
feud continued to disturb the peace of the University
for several generations. The Northern party was apparently
the weaker in the University, perhaps because
it had sympathised with Simon de Montfort. Accordingly
we learn from Anthony Wood that, in 1334,
Merton College, which had been suspected of favouring
that party, sought to regain popularity in the University
by declining to admit Northern scholars. Again, in
1349, a strong faction in the same college succeeded in
procuring the election of Wylliott as Chancellor by
force, driving out the Northern proctor, and committing
acts of sanguinary violence. In 1327, we hear of a
‘most bloody outrage’ committed by the scholars and
townsmen of Oxford, joined with the townsmen of
Abingdon, on the monks of Abingdon Abbey; and in
1349-50 the ravages of the Black Death were such that
Oxford was almost deserted by its students, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
Warden of Merton is said to have died of the plague.
Two other memorable events occurred in the reign of
Edward III., which deserve more special notice, since
they fill a considerable space in the historical records of
the University. The one of these was the secession to
Stamford in 1333; the other was the great riot which
broke out on St. Scholastica’s Day, 1354.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Early secessions
to
Cambridge
and Northampton</div>

<p>The secession to Stamford was by no means the first
migration of Oxford students to another provincial town
since the foundation of the University. In
1209 and again in 1239 bodies of discontented
Oxonians had betaken themselves to
Cambridge, and in 1260 a more important secession
took place, of which two different accounts have
been given. According to one, the emigrants were
Northern students who had sided with Simon de Montfort
when he summoned his Parliament to Oxford in
1258, and framed those articles which became the signal
for civil war. It is further stated that, having been
joined at Northampton by refugees from Cambridge,
and distinguished themselves in defending the town
against the Royal forces, they narrowly escaped the
King’s vengeance. According to another account,
supported by the authority of Anthony Wood, the King
himself, fearing the effect of political excitement on the
masters and scholars of the University, expressly sanctioned
and encouraged the new settlement at Northampton,
specially recommending the emigrants to the
good offices of the mayor and bailiffs. At all events,
their stay at Northampton was short, for they returned
to Oxford in 1264 or 1265, apparently in obedience to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
a Royal order, but under a safe conduct from Simon de
Montfort. It was doubtless this Northampton colony
which the founder of Merton had in view when, in his
first statutes issued in 1264, he gave the rulers of his
new society power to remove the students from Oxford
to some other University town—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aut alibi, uli studium
viget generale</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secession to
Stamford in
1333</div>

<p>The origin of the ‘University at Stamford’ is still
more obscure. Anthony Wood tells us simply that
several masters, bachelors, and scholars of
Oxford ‘did under colour of some discord
among them, and upon some pretences sought after,
depart hence unto Stamford, in Lincolnshire, and
there began, or rather renewed and continued, an
academy.’ The seceders themselves, appealing to
Edward III. in January 1334, for permission to continue
their studies at Stamford, vaguely attributed their withdrawal
from Oxford to disputes and disorders which had
long prevailed in that University. We may conjecture
that it was a secession of Northern students, but the
only certain fact is that it was headed by one William
de Barnaby. The University of Oxford, much alarmed
by the ‘schism,’ as it was called, invoked the aid of the
Queen and the Bishop of Lincoln. At last, the King
intervened, but it was not till after three Royal monitions
and the seizure of their goods, that the malcontents
were ejected from Stamford, and the short-lived University
broken up in the summer of 1335. A list of
offenders was sent to Edward III., but it only contained
thirty-eight names, including those of seventeen masters.
The ‘Academy’ at Stamford, however, left traces in the
local names of streets, which are not even yet wholly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
effaced, and the jealousy inspired by its rivalry was not
extinguished for more than a century. An University
statute of uncertain date, but clearly later than 1425,
and evidently re-enacting an order already in force, requires
every inceptor in any faculty to swear that he
will not recognise any University besides Oxford and
Cambridge, and that he will not lecture or read at
Stamford. Meanwhile, a compact was made between
Oxford and Cambridge for their mutual protection
against competition, and the dual monopoly of the two
ancient Universities was henceforth established.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Growth of
the proctorial
authority</div>

<p>The peace of the University was further promoted
in this turbulent age by the gradual development of the
proctorial authority. The origin of the proctors’,
like that of the Chancellor’s, office is
enveloped in much obscurity. The first
proctors named in the official list, which follows the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fasti</i> of Anthony Wood, are Roger de Plumpton and
Henry de Godfree, who are set down as having officiated
in 1267. Proctors are also mentioned by name under
the dates 1281, 1286, and 1288. During the first half
of the fourteenth century the entries of proctors occur
in fifteen years only, but in one case the same two
proctors are expressly stated to have served for two
years, and it is quite possible that, even if the election
was annual, others may have served for longer periods.
Whatever may have been their original functions, there
can be no doubt that in 1322, if not much earlier, they
became the chief executive officers of the University.
It was a main part of their duty to keep the peace, as
best they could, not only between scholars and townspeople,
but also between the numerous factions among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
the scholars themselves, between the friars and secular
clergy, between the ‘artists’ and the ‘jurists,’ the Nominalists
and the Realists, the English students and those
from Wales, Scotland, or Ireland, and, most of all, the
Northern and Southern nations. The standing quarrel
between these great academic parties overshadowed and
absorbed into itself all minor rivalries, and influenced
every important question for academic action, especially
the election of the Chancellor. According to Anthony
Wood, it was in order to secure fairness and good order
in these elections that, in 1343, the University agreed
that one proctor should always be a Northerner and the
other a Southerner, for the purpose of acting as scrutineers
of the votes. On the other hand, the analogy
of the University of Paris might lead us to regard
them as representatives, from the very first, of the
‘nations.’ At all events, their powers were infinitely
wider and more various than those of mere returning-officers.
They kept the money and accounts of the
University, regulated the whole system of lectures and
disputations, were responsible for academical discipline,
and were empowered to impeach the Chancellor himself.
Like him, they were elected by the whole body of
regents and non-regents in Congregation, but their
elections never required the confirmation of the Bishop
of Lincoln as diocesan, whereas that of the Chancellor,
as we have seen, was originally held invalid until it had
been thus confirmed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Concession
by the Pope
of freedom
in the election
of the
Chancellor</div>

<p>In the reign of Edward III., however, a great step
was made towards academical independence by the
disuse of this practice, and thenceforth the University
chose its Chancellor as freely as its proctors. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
years before the way had been paved for this revolt
against ecclesiastical jurisdiction by a solemn compact
between the University and the Cardinal de
Mota, then Archdeacon of Oxford by Papal
provision, but permanently non-resident. This
Cardinal-Archdeacon had assumed to exercise
authority over the University through certain agents
who practised extortions for his benefit. Thence
arose a controversy which lasted twenty years, the
Cardinal having instituted proceedings against the
University at the Papal Court, while the University
appealed first to Edward II. and afterwards to Edward
III., both of whom, following the settled policy of the
Plantagenet kings, vigorously intervened on its behalf.
At last, after tedious negotiations, a compromise, very
favourable to University rights, was effected by the
mediation of William Bateman, Bishop of Norwich.
The Chancellor was declared to have archidiaconal jurisdiction
over all doctors, masters, and scholars, religious
and lay, and even over all rectors, vicars, and chaplains
within the University, unless they should hold cures of
souls in Oxford, in which case they should pay canonical
obedience to the archdeacon. Moreover, in 1368, a Bull
was procured from Pope Urban, solemnly ordaining that
thenceforth the election of a Chancellor by the University
itself should be sufficient, without the confirmation
of the diocesan. The reason alleged is a very practical
one—that great inconvenience and even danger to the
peace of the University had resulted from the necessity
of sending a deputation to follow the Bishop into distant
parts, while in the meantime there was no resident
officer to keep turbulent persons in order.</p>

<span class="fs80">CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY AND THE CITY.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Royal
award of
1290</div>

<p class="no-indent">The famous riot of St. Scholastica’s Day, 1354, may be
regarded as the sequel of a similar fray in 1297. Both
were simply violent eruptions of a deep-seated
feud between the University and city of
Oxford, which had been growing for several generations.
In the year 1290, these bodies appeared by their deputies
before the King and Parliament, when certain articles
of peace were concluded, under Royal authority, which
exhibit in a compendious form the main grievances of
the citizens. Most of these grievances relate to alleged
abuses of the Chancellor’s criminal jurisdiction; others
have reference to more or less oppressive privileges of
the University, such as its claim to something like fixity
of rent, if not of tenure, for houses in the occupation of
scholars. On each point submitted to him the King’s
award is conspicuous for its good sense and moderation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Riot of 1297
and agreement
of 1298</div>

<p>The complaints here formulated in the most authentic
shape enable us to understand the bitter animosity which
aggravated town-and-gown rows of the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries into sanguinary
conflicts sometimes bordering upon civil war. Contests
about municipal franchises, prices of provisions, and
rents of halls or inns, were eagerly fanned into a flame
by the impetuous passions of youth, unrestrained by the
kindlier sentiments of humanity and respect for others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
which temper party-spirit in this happier age. But
seven years had elapsed since this award of Edward I.
had been made, when, as Anthony Wood tells us, ‘there
arose a grievous discord between the clerks and laics of
Oxford, occasioned by the fighting of two servants of
various countries that were upon some small occasion
invited thereunto.’ Several murderous affrays had
already taken place since the incident thus noticed,
before any general muster of townspeople or students
took place. In the meantime the Chancellor exerted
himself to restore order, but several aldermen and leading
citizens headed the mob, who sacked various scholars’
houses and defeated a body of gownsmen on the favourite
battle-ground of the Beaumont. After this it appears
the Chancellor declined to comply with the mayor’s request
that he would confine the gownsmen to their inns.
Accordingly, on the following day the bells of St.
Mary’s, as well as of St. Martin’s, called the combatants
to arms, and several thousands are said to have engaged
in the desperate fray which ensued. At first the gownsmen
carried all before them, being superior both in
weapons and in defensive armour, and broke open many
shops and dwellings of the burghers. But the death of
their leader and the irruption of rustic labourers from
the country to aid the townspeople ultimately turned
the tide of battle against them. Once compelled to
retreat, they were hunted down and brutally maltreated
by the populace; several were killed; others were torn
from the sanctuaries to which they had fled, and driven
with whips and goads into the castle gaol. The ordinary
retribution followed. The citizens implicated in the
disturbance were excommunicated by the Bishop of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Lincoln; some of the worst offenders were consigned to
the Chancellor’s prison; two bailiffs were removed from
their office, and other persons were banished from
Oxford. A ‘final agreement’ made between the University
and city in 1298, and preserved in the University
archives, records these sentences, together with a
general amnesty for all other offences prior to the agreement,
and a renewed promise on the part of the City to
respect all the privileges of the University.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Great riot
of 1354</div>

<p>How long this truce lasted we have no means of
knowing, but no equally murderous encounter took
place at Oxford until St. Scholastica’s Day,
Feb. 10, 1354.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Like the riot of 1297, it
arose out of a trumpery squabble, but was carried on
for three days with all the savage fury of an Irish faction
fight. Two students drinking at the Swyndlestock, or
Mermaid, tavern, near Carfax, assaulted the landlord,
and were forcibly ejected. Again the bell of St.
Martin’s was rung by order of the mayor, and that of
St. Mary’s by order of the Chancellor, at whom an arrow
had been shot by one of the citizens. In the disturbances
which immediately followed no one seems to have
been mortally wounded; but on the following morning,
notwithstanding the efforts of the Chancellor, ostensibly
seconded by the mayor, a general battle was commenced
by the citizens, armed with bows and arrows, who drove
the scholars out of the Augustine schools, cleared the
whole northern suburb of their enemies, and sent messengers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
to call in reinforcements from the neighbouring
villages. To bar the entrance of these auxiliaries, the
scholars made themselves masters of the northern and
eastern gates; but the villagers, making a circuit,
poured in by the west gate, numbering, it is said,
nearly 2,000, and swept the streets with fierce cries of
‘Slay, slay!’ ‘Havock and havock!’ The gownsmen
were fairly overborne, and not only that evening but a
great part of the next day was spent by the victorious
townspeople in glutting their savage vengeance, pillaging
hall after hall, and killing or wounding any scholar
who fell into their hands; indeed, if we are to believe
Anthony Wood, they went so far as to scalp more than
one chaplain whom they captured, in contempt of the
priestly tonsure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interdict
and penance</div>

<p>Such an outrage roused the whole clerical order, and
the Church took up the quarrel of the University as her
own. After due inquiry an interdict was laid
upon the city by the Bishop of Lincoln, and
all the municipal authorities, if not all the lay inhabitants,
were visited with ‘the major excommunication.’
They appear to have remained under ecclesiastical
censure for some three years, since the relaxation of the
interdict and the indenture of peace between the University
and city bear date May 1357. We learn from
these documents that at last the city made a complete
and humble submission, confessing itself deserving of a
like excommunication if it should ever again sin in like
manner, and binding itself to accept whatever penance
the Bishop should lay upon it. This penance consisted
in the signature of a compact under which the mayor,
bailiffs, and sixty leading citizens were obliged to attend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
mass every year in St. Mary’s Church on St. Scholastica’s
Day, and to offer at the high altar one penny each, of
which sum two-thirds was to be distributed at once by
the proctors among poor scholars. The city also undertook
to pay one hundred marks annually to the University
by way of compensation on the same day, but was
relieved from this obligation by a deed of even date,
upon condition of the other compact being duly fulfilled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New charter
granted by
the King</div>

<p>In the meantime, however, the mayor and burgesses
had formally resigned their ancient franchises into the
King’s hands, and the University received a
new charter of privileges and immunities as a
reward for the indignities to which it had been subjected
on St. Scholastica’s Day. Under this charter, the Chancellor
of the University obtained the sole control over
the ‘assize’ of bread, wine, ale, and beer; over the
‘assay’ of weights and measures, with jurisdiction in all
cases of ‘forestalling,’ ‘regrating,’ and selling unwholesome
food; over the assessment of rates and taxes, the
management of the streets, and like municipal affairs.
He was also empowered to expel all disorderly students,
and the provision for the forfeiture of their arms shows
how generally arms were carried in those turbulent days.
Moreover, though he was not as yet permitted to rescue
and sit in judgment on scholars accused of treason,
murder, or ‘mayhem,’ this privilege was afterwards
conceded by letters patent of 1407; but it was provided
that academical prisoners should be tried before a mixed
jury of gownsmen and townspeople. It is not difficult
to understand how galling such concessions must have
been to the citizens of Oxford, and however gross the
outrages for which they were the atonement, we can
hardly wonder that a bitter grudge should have been
cherished by the City against the University so long as
they remained in force.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE MONKS AND FRIARS AT OXFORD.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Benedictines
and Augustinians</div>

<p class="no-indent">The history of the monastic settlements at Oxford, and
of their connection with the University, still remains to
be written, but enough is known to show how
great a part they played in its earlier life.
For some time before, and for two generations after
the Norman Conquest, the Benedictine monks of St.
Frideswide, having displaced the secular canons, seem
to have been the only body of regular clergy in Oxford.
In the monasteries of this Order had been sheltered
most of the scanty learning and culture which survived
the night of the Dark Ages. Having been well nigh
crushed out and despoiled of their few literary treasures
in two Danish invasions, they had revived and extended
their influence in the eleventh century. In the reign
of Henry I., Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, is said to have
established a convent of Augustinian canons at St.
Frideswide’s, under the care of Guimond, chaplain to
the King, and soon after 1129 they were reinforced by
a society of the same Order inhabiting the new abbey
founded in that year at Oseney. It does not clearly
appear how far the Benedictines were dislodged from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
Oxford by the new-comers, but they probably retained
houses there for their students until they obtained
possession of Gloucester Hall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rise of
mendicant
Orders</div>

<p>If the claustral schools of the Benedictines were the
nursery of the University, a still more powerful impulse
was imparted to it at a later period by the
rise of the two great mendicant Orders, both
of which received munificent aid from Henry III. In
1221 the Dominicans, or Black Friars, first appeared in
Oxford, and located themselves in the heart of the
Jewry, from which they migrated forty years afterwards
into a new monastery by the water-gate in the parish
of St. Ebbe’s, near the modern Speedwell Street. Two
or three years later a little band of Franciscans, or Grey
Friars, after a temporary residence in Canterbury and
London, found their way to Oxford, where they were
hospitably entertained by the Dominicans, and obtained
the loan of a house or hall in the parish of St. Ebbe’s.
Notwithstanding their exemplary self-denial and boundless
charity, they succeeded in accumulating funds
sufficient to build a magnificent church on a site near
Paradise Gardens, and opened schools of their own.
After the lapse of another generation—in 1251 or
1252—a company of Augustinian Friars were sent
into England by Lanfranc, of Milan, and a detachment
of them settled on the southern part of the site now
occupied by Wadham College, purchased for them by
Sir John Handlow, of Boarstall. Here were instituted
those famous disputations which, under the name of
‘Austins,’ became the chief school of academical grammar
teaching in the Middle Ages, and survived in a
degenerate form until the end of the last century. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
1254 the Carmelite, or White Friars, took up their
abode close by the Castle, whence they were transferred
to Beaumont Palace by Edward II. in 1313. In 1281
or 1291 Edmund, Earl of Cornwall, founded, or refounded,
the Cistercian Abbey of Rewley, and established
a brotherhood of Trinitarians without the East
Gate. Meanwhile the Benedictines had adopted Gloucester
Hall (now Worcester College) as a seminary for
their younger members.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Claustral
schools</div>

<p>Other smaller religious fraternities are known to
have existed in Oxford, and neighbouring abbeys, such
as those of Oseney, Eynsham, Littlemore, and
Dorchester, kept houses in Oxford for the
instruction of boys and young men under their special
charge. The systematic teaching of theology was doubtless
the main object of the lessons given in the old
claustral schools, and the curriculum of secular education
was as meagre in reality as it was imposing in
profession. Yet even in these a true spirit of scholarship
was kept alive, and the great teachers of the mendicant
Orders were the leading exponents of the new
Aristotelian philosophy, which inspired the subtlest
intellects of the thirteenth century with the power of a
revelation. These Orders possessed a great advantage
over the University itself, before colleges were founded,
in occupying handsome and spacious buildings, attractive
to poor students, while the University schools or
lecture rooms were apparently little better than sheds,
and St. Mary’s Church was the one edifice capable of
being used for solemn academical functions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Migration
from Paris
and influence
of
Robert
Grosteste</div>

<p>Two causes favoured the rapid establishment of the
mendicant Orders, and especially of the Franciscans, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
the schools of Oxford. In the year 1228 a memorable
conflict took place between the students and
citizens in Paris, in which the students were
grossly maltreated. Queen Blanche refused
them redress, but Henry III. invited them to
settle in England, and Oxford, as well as
Cambridge, benefited largely by the migration which
ensued.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> These Paris students were mostly the disciples
of Dominican or Franciscan professors, some of whom
seem to have accompanied them, and when the Dominicans
again became paramount at Paris, the Franciscans
retained a stronghold at Oxford. Here they owed much
to the powerful aid and patronage of Robert Grosteste,
the great scholastical and ecclesiastical reformer of the
thirteenth century. The fame of this remarkable man
for scholarship, as well as piety, rests upon the universal
testimony of his own and the succeeding age, including
that of Roger Bacon, himself perhaps the brightest
luminary of mediæval Oxford. But it is only of late
that his influence upon the University has been fully
understood. It was indeed an extraordinary chance
which elevated to the See of Lincoln, then possessing a
paramount jurisdiction over the University of Oxford,
a man who had been the foremost of Oxford teachers,
the first theological lecturer of the Franciscans. It was
as a working professor and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rector scholarum</i> that
he infused new life into University studies by the comprehensive
vigour and originality of his teaching.
When he commenced his stormy episcopate in 1235, his
attention was inevitably directed to larger questions
then disturbing the peace of Church and State, but his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
spirit animated his staunch friend and successor, Adam
Marsh (or de Marisco), the great Franciscan college-tutor,
as he may well be called. It is the glory of the
Franciscans to have produced in the same age Adam
Marsh and Roger Bacon, who is sometimes claimed as
an early Fellow of Merton College, but who really
belongs to a period immediately preceding the foundation
of colleges. Though Roger Bacon attests the premature
degeneracy of the mendicant Orders in his own
lifetime, though his bold vindication of scientific truth
is little in harmony with the abject submission to
Papal authority enjoined upon the friars, and though he
was actually persecuted by his own community for
persevering in his scientific researches, yet he was
essentially a Franciscan. It was in obedience to his
patron, Clement IV., that he compiled his three great
treatises, embodying a knowledge which no other scholar
of his time possessed, advocating the claims of mathematics
and language against the frivolous dialectics of
the mediæval schools, and censuring without reserve the
organised ignorance which then usurped the place of
science and philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of
the friars at
Oxford, and

statutes
against
them</div>

<p>It is extremely difficult to ascertain the nature of
the control which the friars acquired over academical
studies, or the place, if any, which they occupied
in the academical system. Of their proselytising
activity we have abundant evidence,
and this was probably the motive of their
constant efforts to secure the privilege of reading and
lecturing in their own schools, instead of in those of the
University; efforts which at Paris seem to have been
more or less successful. At Oxford they are clearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
recognised as religious bodies in a curious ordinance of
1300, which enjoins that in academical processions the
Preaching Friars shall walk first, the White Friars
next, and the Black Friars last. It is scarcely less
significant that, although in 1314 the church of St.
Mary was made the one authorised arena of academic
ceremonies, to the exclusion of the religious houses, the
four Orders were represented jointly with the University
on the Papal Commission which delivered this decision.
In another statute, of 1326, every bachelor of arts is
required to dispute once and respond once each year
before the Augustins (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apud Augustinenses</i>), from which
it must be inferred that this Order had already acquired
almost a monopoly of grammar-teaching.</p>

<p>But the lay and secular element in the University
always rebelled against the encroachments of the friars,
and was destined to prevail. It is a suggestive fact
that Walter de Merton rigorously excluded every ‘religious’
person or member of a monastic Order from the
benefits of his foundation. Soon afterwards the University
took alarm. In 1358<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> we have a trenchant
statute against the abduction of boys under eighteen by
the mendicant Orders, which shows how great a jealousy
they had provoked among the secular clergy of the
University, for whose special benefit Merton and other
colleges were founded. This statute expressly recites
that noblemen and commoners are afraid to send their
sons to the University, lest they should be seduced by
the mendicant friars into joining their Order before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
arriving at years of discretion; and that by these
practices the peace of the University is often disturbed
and its numbers diminished. It is therefore enacted
that if any mendicant friar thus seduces or causes to be
seduced any youth under eighteen years of age, or
procures his removal from Oxford with intent that he
may be received elsewhere into a religious Order, no
graduate of the cloister or society to which the offender
belongs shall be allowed to deliver or attend lectures in
Oxford during the year next ensuing. Another statute
of the same date is apparently aimed at the attempt of
friars to lecture on logic before undergoing the regular
yearly course of disputations. This is immediately
followed by the public recantation extorted from a friar
who had affirmed, among other startling propositions,
that tithes belonged more properly to mendicants than
to rectors of churches, and that the University was a
school of heresy. Another friar who had disparaged
the School of Arts was compelled to apologize with
equal humility. Still the power of the monastic Orders
continued to be formidable, and at Cambridge they
seem to have ultimately carried their point in obtaining
exemption from academical exercises in Arts for their
theological students; while at Oxford there are many
instances of college fellows joining their ranks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intervention
of the
Pope and
the King</div>

<p>In 1365 the Pope entered the lists against the
University on behalf of the friars, and directed the
Archbishop of Canterbury and bishops to insist
upon the Chancellor’s procuring the repeal
of the obnoxious statutes. In the meantime,
however, the intervention of the King and Parliament
was invoked by memorials from both the Universities and
the four mendicant Orders. In consequence of this an
ordinance was made, with the assent of Parliament, by
which the statutes against the admission of scholars
into these Orders were relaxed, but all bulls and
processes to be procured by the friars against the Universities
from the Court of Rome were prohibited and
declared void. Still the feud continued. One main
source of Wyclif’s popularity in the University was his
unsparing denunciation of the Mendicants, and their
decline was among the most permanent results of the
movement which he initiated. But other causes were
at work to undermine their influence. The rise of the
colleges was, in fact, the rise of the secular clergy, and
in organising itself more completely, the University
naturally outgrew its dependence on the missionary
zeal for education which had been its life-blood in the
thirteenth century.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE UNIVERSITY IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Decline in
numbers
and studies</div>

<p class="no-indent">The golden age of mediæval Oxford had culminated
in the fourteenth century, and the fifteenth century
ushered in a period of intellectual stagnation,
which lasted for at least sixty years. Many
causes, both external and internal, combined to produce
this result. The nation itself, exhausted by the
vain effort to conquer France, and roused from its long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
dream of Imperial ambition, was hopeless and disheartened
until it was plunged into the most sanguinary of
English Civil Wars. The ecclesiastical independence
of the English Church, which had defied the most
powerful of mediæval Popes, and had been fortified by
the recent Statutes of Provisors and Præmunire, was
seriously threatened by the growth of Ultramontane
influences, while its revenues were assailed by democratic
agitation. The revolutionary petition of the Commons,
addressed to Henry IV., for the wholesale appropriation
of Church property to secular and charitable uses, boded
no good to Universities, which ranked as ecclesiastical
bodies, and were taxed with the clergy, though anti-monastic
in their corporate spirit and in the organisation
of their colleges. Moreover, this petition had been
speedily followed by the actual confiscation of property
belonging to alien priories. Soon afterwards, the French
Wars and Wars of the Roses attracted into camps many
a student who might otherwise have frequented the
University lecture rooms; the law no longer drew all
its recruits from University clerks; and even the incumbents
of English livings were sometimes chosen
from the ranks of the regular clergy without University
training. It is possible that the rise and spread of the
Wycliffite movement at Oxford may have prejudiced it
in the eyes of the English hierarchy, as it certainly did
in those of the Popes. At all events, there is abundant
evidence both of the fact that candidates for Holy Orders
resorted to Oxford in diminished numbers, and of the
construction which the University authorities put on
that fact. In 1417, and again in 1438, the Archbishop
and Bishops in Convocation issued an appeal to patrons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
of benefices, calling upon them to give a preference to
University graduates. The memorial addressed to
Convocation on behalf of the University in 1438 complains
that her halls were deserted, and that not one
thousand remained out of the many thousands reported
to have attended the schools of Oxford in the last age—when,
as we learn from a Royal charter (of 1355), ‘a
multitude of nobles, gentry, strangers, and others continually
flocked thither.’ It is stated that in 1450
only twenty out of two hundred schools which had once
been filled continued to be used for purposes of education.
A few years later we find a license granted to
poor scholars, authorising them to beg for alms—a
practice of which Sir Thomas More speaks as if it were
not obsolete in his own time. It was to meet the necessities
of these destitute students that Archbishop
Chichele established a new University Chest; and it
was for the relief of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pauperes et indigentes</i>, no less
than for the support of the secular clergy, whose decline
at Oxford is amply attested by his charter, that he
afterwards founded the great college of All Souls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">University
delegates at
the Councils
of Constance
and Basle</div>

<p>Notwithstanding this decline, and the undoubted
decay of learning, we must not exaggerate either the
actual degeneracy of the University or its
loss of reputation in Europe. No doubt, the
French Wars tended to weaken its ancient
alliance with the great University of Paris, and the
growth of a native English literature under the inspiration
of Chaucer and Wyclif may well have contributed
to its isolation, until it came under the spell of
the Italian Renaissance. But it is an error to assert
that Oxford was ‘nowhere to be found in the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
Church Councils of the fifteenth century.’<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> On the
contrary, it was very ably represented, both at Constance
in 1414 and at Basle in 1431. At the former of these
Councils, Henry de Abendon, afterwards Warden of
Merton, defended with signal effect the claim of England
to precedence over Spain, and of Oxford to precedence
over Salamanca. In order to defray the expense
of sending ‘orators’ to Basle, the University, in its
poverty, solicited a contribution, ‘were it ever so small,’
from the Convocation of the Clergy. It found a worthy
delegate, however, in John Kemp, also of Merton, afterwards
Archbishop of Canterbury, who, at the subsequent
Council of Florence, was made a Cardinal by the
Pope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foundation
of Lincoln
and All Souls’
Colleges</div>

<p>Nor must we forget the great collegiate institutions
which owe their origin to this obscure period. The first of
these, Lincoln College, was founded in 1427, on
a much humbler scale than New College, by
Richard Flemmyng, Bishop of Lincoln, who,
having been a zealous promoter, became a fanatical opponent
of Wyclif’s doctrines, and distinguished himself at
the Council of Siena by attacks against the Hussites. His
main object was to extirpate the Wycliffite heresy, and
he specially provided that any Fellow tainted with these
heresies was ‘to be cast out, like a diseased sheep, from
the fold of the college.’ All Souls, founded in 1438 by
Archbishop Chichele, was a far grander monument of
academical piety and was almost unique in its constitution.
The college was specially designed to be a
chantry, but it was also to be a place of study, and was
to some extent modelled on New College, where Chichele<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
himself was educated. There were to be forty scholars,
being clerks, bound to study without intermission,
twenty-four of whom were to cultivate Arts and philosophy
or theology, and sixteen the canon or civil law.
Magdalen College was founded in 1457 by William of
Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester, upon a plan borrowed
from New College, but without the peculiar feature of
organic connection with a public school, though its
founder had been himself the head-master both of Eton
and of Winchester. There are clear traces in the
statutes of the coming Renaissance. Theology remains
supreme, as at New College, but moral and natural
philosophy take the place of civil and canon law.
Grammar is preferred to logic, and even Latin verses
are recognised. Moreover, the lecturers in divinity and
the two philosophies are to instruct not only the college
but the whole University.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extension of
University
buildings:
the Divinity
School and
the Bodleian
Library</div>

<p>While the collegiate system was thus expanding,
and classical scholarship was beginning to germinate
under its shelter, the resources of the University
were enriched by two important accessions—the
edifice of the Old Schools, and
the Library presented by the ‘good’ Duke
Humphry of Gloucester. In the early part of the
fifteenth century, thirty-two ‘schools’ were ranged
along School Street, between the west end of St. Mary’s
and the city wall, near the present theatre. These
schools had superseded the simple chambers which the
University had a prescriptive right to hire in the houses
of private citizens. Many of them belonged to Oseney
Abbey, and in the year 1439 some fourteen of these,
being ruinous, were taken down and rebuilt by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Abbot, Thomas Hokenorton. The fabric erected by
him is described as a long pile of stone masonry, wholly
destitute of architectural effect, consisting of two stories,
and divided into ten schools, five above and five below,
which, however, possessed no monopoly of University
lectures or exercises, since these continued to be carried
on in other public schools, if not in private lecture
rooms, despite prohibitory statutes. One reason why
School Street was selected as the privileged quarter for
lecturing was doubtless that it immediately adjoined
St. Mary’s Church, which contained the old Congregation-house,
in which the University held all its solemn
meetings, and which, in the Middle Ages, had served at
once as the court-house, the legislative chamber, the
examination-room, the public treasury, the hall of
assembly, and the place of worship, for the whole
University. In this church theological lectures had
now been given for a century, since the Dominicans and
Franciscans had been compelled to abandon their practice
of teaching divinity to University students within their
own walls, and the University could afford to despise
the rivalry of other religious Orders lodged in the
suburbs, at a distance from School Street. In 1426 or
1427 a vacant plot was purchased by the University
from Balliol College, and in 1480 the present Divinity
School was finally opened for the greatest of the faculties,
by the aid of liberal contributions from the
Benedictine monks, Archbishop Chichele, several cathedral
bodies, Duke Humphry, and the executors of
Cardinal Beaufort, Archbishop Kemp, and Edmund
Duke of Somerset of 1447. In the meantime, Duke
Humphry, acceding to a suggestion from the University,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
had initiated the erection of a Public Library over the
Divinity School. The building was retarded by the
withdrawal of the masons, under Royal mandate, for
works at Windsor and Eton, nor was it completed till
1480, by the aid of Thomas Kemp, Bishop of London,
who contributed 1,000 marks, and has been regarded as
a second founder. The original collection of books presented
by Duke Humphry to the University in 1439
consisted of 129 volumes only, but it was supplemented
by a second gift in 1443. Still, the whole University
Library, comprising the previous legacies of Angerville
and Cobham, is said to have contained no more than
500 volumes when it was dispersed at the Reformation.
Duke Humphry is also said to have instituted a professorial
Chair for Arts and Philosophy, which, however,
never came into operation, perhaps because the means
were not forthcoming to endow it adequately. For it is
certain that at this period the resources of the University
were miserably small, and chiefly wasted in the enormous
expense of suits at the Court of Rome, whose
appellate jurisdiction it had always respected, and whose
immediate intervention it often invoked.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Final organisation
of
mediæval
lectures and
examinations</div>

<p>The mediæval system of academical studies and
examinations may be considered to have reached its
maturity in the middle of the fifteenth century.
At this period the University enjoyed comparative
repose, and its constitution was fully
organised, though its vigour, as we have seen,
was grievously impaired. Nine colleges had already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
been founded, and, by the statute passed in 1432 for
the suppression of ‘chamber-dekyns,’ all members of the
University were required to be inmates of some college
or hall, except those who should be specially licensed
by the Chancellor to live in lay houses. By another
statute of the same year, the discipline of the University
had been further secured by a peremptory rule that all
principals of halls should be graduates, or qualified by
learning and character to rule their respective households.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
The proctorial authority was now firmly
established under the ordinance of 1343. Courses of
public lectures were constantly delivered on all the
subjects recognised by the University in the official
schools, and private instruction was supplied to their
own inmates by the various colleges and halls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">University
curriculum</div>

<p>The institution of an University curriculum, or a set
course of books or subjects to be studied by candidates
for degrees in the various faculties, may be
dated from the statutes given to the University
of Paris by the Cardinal Legate, Robert de
Courçon, at the very beginning of the thirteenth century.
The Oxford curriculum seems to have varied but little
between the age of the schoolmen and that of the
Renaissance. It is practically certain that admission
to the University was guarded by no entrance examination.
Grammar was treated as the essential foundation
of all knowledge, and the University abounded in
grammar schools, but the superstructure raised upon
this foundation appears to have been mainly logical.
Both grammar and logic, however, represented accomplishments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
which in that age were supposed to be useful—grammar
as giving the power of reading and
writing Latin; logic, supplemented by rhetoric, as the
instrument of controversy and persuasion. Since proficiency
in all studies was tested by disputation, logic
was naturally elevated into a position of supremacy. A
statute passed in 1408 required all candidates for what
is now called a B.A. degree to become ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sophistæ
generales</i>,’ and practise themselves in logical disputations
for a year at least in the ‘Parvisum,’ or classrooms
for beginners, before offering themselves for the
preliminary ordeal of Responsions. This examination
seems to have consisted in arguing and answering
questions on a given thesis (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">respondere ad quæstionem</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de quæstione</i>), and the student who had passed it at the
end of his first year was still bound under this statute to
hear lectures on prescribed books in three branches of
the Faculty of Arts—logic, mathematics, and grammar,
which always ranked lowest in the scale of studies. The
exercises which constituted ‘determination’<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> were conducted
during Lent in the schools of Masters apparently
selected by the candidates themselves, for the last
clause in the statute actually protects them against
impressment or solicitation by Masters desirous of
forcing them into their own schools. The examination
was mainly, if not exclusively, logical and grammatical,
the duty of the examining master being to stop the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
candidate if he should wander into other subjects or use
unsound arguments. Nothing is said in this statute
of candidates once admitted to determine being rejected
for incompetence, but there are rules to prevent their
being admitted at all, unless duly qualified by character,
ability, age, and even stature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Statute of
1431, regulating
‘inception’</div>

<p>The leading statute which regulated the more important
act of ‘inception,’ or admission to the M.A.
degree, was passed in 1431. It opens with
a somewhat pedantic and solemn preamble,
setting forth that everyone who aspires to be
entitled a Master or Professor of Arts ought to have
undergone a complete training in the seven sciences
and the three philosophies. These seven sciences were
no other than the old Trivials and Quadrivials which
had become the standard subjects of education ever since
the revival of learning under Charlemagne—grammar,
rhetoric and logic; arithmetic, music, geometry and
astronomy. The three so-called philosophies were
natural, moral, and metaphysical. The statute proceeds
to ordain that all who are presented for ‘inception’
shall have satisfied all the requirements for ‘determination,’
and shall also have regularly and earnestly
attended lectures in the seven branches of knowledge
here called the seven liberal Arts, as well as in the three
philosophies, during eight years for at least thirty
‘reading’ days in each year,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> according to a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
graduated order prescribed in the statute itself. Thus,
grammar was to occupy one year, rhetoric three years,
logic three years, arithmetic one year, music one year,
geometry two years, astronomy two years, natural philosophy,
moral philosophy, and metaphysical philosophy
three years each. The orthodox text-books in which each
subject is to be studied are specifically mentioned, and
include Priscian, Boethius, and Euclid, but, above all,
Aristotle, who is recognised as the supreme authority on
rhetoric, logic, and all three philosophies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duties of
regent
masters</div>

<p>Having fulfilled all these conditions, and procured
all the necessary certificates of his moral and intellectual
competence, the bachelor applying for a M.A.
degree was presented before the Chancellor
and Proctors in Congregation, when, after taking certain
oaths, one of which bound him not to foment quarrels
between Northerners and Southerners, he was officially
licensed to deliver lectures. On this ceremony, which
constituted him a Master of Arts, the statute of 1431
is silent, but we know from other sources that a M.A.
degree was chiefly, if not exclusively, sought as a passport
to ‘inception.’ This inception, which involved much expense<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
and was attended by many formalities, consisted
in taking possession of a school, and solemnly commencing
a course of lectures as a teaching or ‘regent’ master. It
is provided in the statute that at the end of every term (or
year) the proctors shall ascertain the number of regent
masters willing to lecture, and shall divide them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
according to seniority, into ten companies as nearly
equal in number as possible. The junior company, with
the superintendents of grammar schools, are to lecture
in grammar, and the rest are apparently to be so ranged
in an ascending scale that the highest subjects may
be assigned to the seniors. It is expressly ordained, in
order to exclude forbidden lore, that none shall lecture
in any books except those allowed by statute. The
mode of lecturing is also strictly prescribed. First, the
text is to be read out, then its substance and meaning
are to be explained; afterwards special passages are to
be noted, and lastly, questions are to be raised and discussed,
but only such as naturally arise out of the text,
so that no prohibited sciences may be taught. Such
provisions for public lecturing were necessary before
either an University professoriate or a system of college
tuition was developed, and all regent masters, unless
exempted, were statutably bound to lecture for nearly
two years after inception. During this period they
were also specially bound to attend the University
‘Congregation,’ by which degrees were granted, and
even when they became non-regents they were liable
to be summoned for this purpose by the University
Bedel, who sounded a bell in order to make a quorum;
whence that assembly was technically called the House
of Regents and Non-Regents. In the earliest times,
when it consisted of teachers only, it had been the sole
legislature of the University. It seems, however, that
when degrees were more and more sought as titles of
honour or certificates of proficiency, and graduates frequently
obtained exemptions from the duty of teaching,
another more select body, called the ‘Black Congregation,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
assumed the right of discussing measures to be
afterwards laid before the ‘Great Congregation,’ as it
then came to be called, or ‘Convocation,’ as it was called
in later times, when the preliminary assembly had at
last usurped the name of ‘Congregation.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Residence
for degrees
in the higher
faculties</div>

<p>The faculty of Arts, however, was but one of several,
though it embraced the great majority of graduates,
and maintained an undisputed supremacy.
The ‘science’ of grammar always filled a subordinate
position, and its requirements were
less onerous, but in all the superior faculties of civil or
canon law, medicine, and theology, the ordinary rule
was to have graduated first in Arts, and afterwards to
have responded, disputed, and determined in the studies
of the faculty before incepting and receiving the final degree
of Master or Doctor, then practically synonymous.
Even those who had graduated in Arts were required to
study theology five years before their ‘opponency’ or
degree-examination, while those who had not so graduated
were compelled to go through a seven years’ course;
and in either case two years more of probation were
exacted before permission could be obtained to lecture
on the ‘Sentences.’ Thus an Oxford career occupied
far more of life in those days than in our own, and
academical residence certainly extended over a greater
part of each year. It was a natural consequence that
University influences left a far deeper impress on the
characters and minds of the students, and that such
movements as the Renaissance and the Reformation
passed through a long period of academical incubation
before they acquired a hold over the mass of the nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revival of
academical
life at the
end of the
fifteenth
century</div>

<p class="no-indent">The reign of Edward IV. may be regarded as a singularly
blank period in University annals. The Wars of the
Roses, in which feudalism perished by its own
hand, but which left so few traces on the
national life, hardly disturbed the academical
repose; and the obscurity which hangs over
the next chapter in the history of the nation rests
equally upon that of the University. But a gradual
recovery was in progress, and soon yielded visible fruits.
The close of the fifteenth century found the University
of Oxford far more complete in its outward structure, if
somewhat less vigorous in its inward life, than it had
been two centuries earlier. It was no longer a loose
aggregate of students under the paramount jurisdiction
of a bishop resident at Lincoln, but an organised institution,
with a government of its own, under the special
protection of the Crown, and capable of being used as a
powerful engine for effecting or resisting changes in
Church or State. While the old order was yielding
place to new, and the fountains of scholastic thought
were running dry, there had been a marked decay in
academical energy, and the declining number of students
attested the decreased activity of teaching. But the
revival of classical learning, promoted by the dispersion
of Greek scholars after the fall of Constantinople, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
accompanied or followed by that marvellous series of
events which divides modern from mediæval history—the
invention of printing, aided by the improvement of
paper-making; the discovery of America; the consolidation
of the European monarchies; and the Reformation
itself. The first effect of the enthusiasm kindled by
these new influences was to invigorate the University;
it was not until their secondary effects were felt that a
reaction manifested itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Checked
by the
Reformation</div>

<p>The great educational movement which sprang from
the Reformation was essentially popular rather than
academical, and by no means tended to
increase the relative importance of the Universities.
The cause of this is not difficult to discover.
When the only books were manuscripts, the Universities
and the very few other institutions which possessed
large collections of manuscripts attracted the whole
literary class from all parts of the country. When
instruction in the sciences was only to be obtained from
the lips of a living teacher, and when schools hardly
existed elsewhere, except in connection with cathedrals
or monasteries, the lecture rooms of Oxford were thronged
with students of all ages, and represented almost the
entire machinery of national education. When the
Church ruled supreme over the wide realm of thought,
and learning was the monopoly of ‘clerics,’ the great
ecclesiastical stronghold of Oxford far surpassed the
metropolis itself as an intellectual centre. When Latin
was the one language of scholars, and English literature
scarcely existed, the academical masters of Latinity,
especially as they were carefully trained in disputation,
maintained a peerless supremacy over their less favoured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
countrymen. In the larger and freer life which took
its birth from the Reformation, the exclusive privileges
of the Universities became inevitably depreciated, and
their degeneracy in the early part of the sixteenth
century presents a humiliating contrast with their
ascendency in the fourteenth. The dissolution of
monasteries, the high-handed visitations of the Tudor
Sovereigns, and the diversion of the national energies
into new careers, operated concurrently to empty Oxford
of students, nor was it until near the end of the century
that its tone was gradually restored by the wise policy
of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pioneers of
the new
learning at
Oxford</div>

<p>During the reign of Henry VII. the University was
strongly agitated by the struggle between the old
scholastic philosophy and the new learning of
the Renaissance. The credit of introducing
classical studies, and especially that of Greek
literature, has sometimes been claimed for the Reformation,
but it is rather due to a liberal spirit then springing
up in the Catholic world, and especially to Italian
influences. It was from Italy that England caught the
new impulse, and that Oxford imported numerous MSS.
of classical authors, while printing was still almost a
fine art. Perhaps the foundation of grammar schools at
Winchester and Eton for the special instruction of boys
in Latin may have contributed to pave the way for the
classical revival at the Universities. At all events, it
was in progress before the Reformation, and was promoted
by several enlightened bishops and abbots of the
old religion, and may not improperly be regarded as a
legacy of Catholic to Protestant England. Writing in
1497, Erasmus, who is sometimes described as the father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
of classical studies in England, speaks of a ‘rich harvest
of classical literature’ as already flourishing at Oxford
on every side, and declares that he could well nigh
forget Italy in the society of Colet, Grocyn, Lynacre, and
More. Indeed, he places England, in respect of culture,
above France or Germany, and second to Italy alone.
In fact, we soon afterwards find Richard Croke, an
Englishman, teaching Greek at Leipsic, whence he
migrated, a few years later, to succeed Erasmus himself
as Professor at Cambridge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Erasmus,
More, Colet,
Grocyn, and
Linacre</div>

<p>During his first visit to Oxford, Erasmus lodged in
a conventual house of Augustin Canons, known as St.
Mary’s College, opposite New Inn Hall. Of
the names thus commemorated by him, that of
Sir Thomas More belongs to the political history
of England, but he also deserves to be remembered
as the young student of Canterbury College, among the
most ardent disciples and most zealous promoters of classical
teaching at Oxford. Colet, who had known More in
the house of Cardinal Morton, and who became famous
as the founder of St. Paul’s School, was educated at
Magdalen College, but afterwards visited France and
Italy, whence he returned in 1497, to lecture publicly
but gratuitously on St. Paul’s Epistles, and to become
a leading pioneer of Latin scholarship in the University.
Grocyn had been elected Fellow of New College as far back
as 1467, and was Divinity Reader at Magdalen College
about 1483. It was not until some years later that he
went to Italy for purposes of study, and devoted himself
to Greek and Latin. On his return, he resided in
Exeter College, and delivered the first public lectures
on Greek, which seem to have been attended by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
Erasmus himself, who speaks of him with unfailing
respect. Lynacre was elected Fellow of All Souls in
1484, but, like Colet and Grocyn, owed his erudition
chiefly to his residence in Italy, where he became Professor
of Medicine at Padua. But his range of studies
was so wide that it was doubted of him whether he was
‘a better Latinist or Grecian, a better grammarian or
physician.’ In modern times he is chiefly known as
among the founders, and as the first President, of the
College of Physicians; while his principal claim to
gratitude at Oxford consists in his posthumous foundation
of two Readerships in Physiology at Merton College,
which have since been consolidated into a Professorship
of Anatomy. The new studies, however, met with violent
opposition, and several University dignitaries publicly
lectured against Erasmus. Indeed, if we are to believe
Anthony Wood, in spite of all the reformers’ efforts,
academical learning was still in a deplorable state in
1508, the last year of Henry VII.’s reign. ‘The schools
were much frequented with querks and sophistry. All
things, whether taught or written, seemed to be trite or
inane. No pleasant streams of humanity or mythology
were gliding among us, and the Greek language, from
whence the greater part of knowledge is derived, was at
a very low ebb, or in a manner forgotten.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foundation
of Corpus
Christi
College by
Bishop Fox</div>

<p>The first endowed lectureship of the Greek language
at Oxford was instituted by Richard Fox, Bishop of Winchester,
in 1516, as part of his new foundation
of Corpus Christi College. His original
intention had been to found a monastery, and
in founding a college instead, with twenty fellows and
twenty scholars, he clearly showed his desire to encourage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
the classics by providing also for Professors of Greek and
Latin, as well as of theology, whose lectures should be
open to all the University. By virtue of this endowment,
Bishop Fox has been regarded as the founder of
the professorial system, though he must perhaps share
that honour, not only with William of Waynflete, but
with Margaret, Countess of Richmond, mother of
Henry VII., who had already founded the Margaret
Professorship of Divinity in 1502. But Fox’s liberal
spirit and sympathy with the Renaissance was shown in
provisions, hitherto unknown, for instruction in the
classical authors, for the colloquial use of Greek as
well as Latin, and for the election of lecturers from
Greece and Southern Italy. It was upon these grounds
that Erasmus predicted a great future for the college as
a stronghold of the classical movement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Greeks and
Trojans</div>

<p>That movement had already provoked a strange
outbreak of academical barbarism in the University of
Oxford. The faction of ‘Trojans,’ as they
called themselves, from their enmity to Greek
letters, seems to have been partly animated by a
popular aversion to change, and partly by a far-sighted
appreciation of the anti-Catholic tendencies inherent in
the Renaissance. It is said to have originated in hostility
to Grocyn’s Greek lectures at Exeter College; but
it reached its height in the early part of Henry VIII.’s
reign, by which time, however, the classics had won
powerful friends at Court, and the ‘Greeks’ were protected
by a peremptory Royal order, issued in 1519.
It is remarkable that no trace of these fierce controversies
between Scholasticism and the New Learning,
still less of the impending revolution in the national<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
religion, is to be discerned in the statutes of Brasenose,
the latest of the pre-Reformation colleges, issued in
1521, nine years after its foundation. Under these
statutes the scholars were bound to study the old
subjects of the scholastic curriculum, ‘Sophistry, Logic,
and Philosophy, and afterwards Divinity ... for the
advancement of Holy Church, and for the support and
exaltation of the Christian faith.’ On the other hand,
there are ample proofs that long before the Old Learning
ceased to rule the University system of disputations and
examinations, the Renaissance had already penetrated
into the University and College Libraries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cardinal
Wolsey and
the foundation
of
Christ
Church</div>

<p>The great minister of Henry VIII., Cardinal Wolsey,
must always be remembered as the most discerning as
well as the most generous patron of liberal
culture, which he admired for its own sake,
though he naturally regarded it as the handmaid
of the Church. It was in 1518 that
Wolsey came to Oxford, in company with Catharine of
Aragon, while the King remained behind at Abingdon.
The University, doubtless perceiving the danger of impending
spoliation, ‘made a solemn and ample decree,
not only of giving up their statutes into the Cardinal’s
hands, to be reformed, corrected, renewed, and the like,
but also their liberties, indulgences, privileges, nay the
whole University (the colleges excepted), to be by him
disposed and framed into good order.’ Wolsey did not
disappoint their confidence, and some five years later (in
1523) returned the charters, with a new and still more
beneficial one procured from the King. At this period
he is believed to have contemplated the foundation of
more than one University professorship and the erection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
of University lecture-rooms, but if he ever entertained
such an idea, it was abandoned. In the meantime, however,
he was projecting the foundation of a college for
secular clergy on a scale of grandeur hitherto unknown,
for the purpose (as Huber well says) of ‘cultivating the
new literature in the service of the old Church.’ In
order to endow ‘Cardinal College,’ as it was to be called,
twenty-two priories and convents were suppressed, under
Papal and Royal authority, and their revenues, amounting
to 2,000<em>l.</em>, were diverted to the maintenance of ten professorships,
as well as of sixty canonists and forty priests.
The students were to be trained in a great school founded
at Ipswich, as those of New College were trained at
Winchester. The first stone of the building was laid in
1525; scholars had been engaged from Cambridge and
the Continent to serve on the professorial staff; the
abbey church of St. Frideswide’s had been appropriated
as the college chapel; and the splendid kitchen, still preserved,
was already completed, when the fall of Wolsey
in 1529 arrested the execution of this grand design.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Action of
the University
on the
questions of
the Divorce
and the
Royal
Supremacy</div>

<p>The King, engrossed with the question of obtaining
a divorce from Catharine of Aragon, was in no mood to
indulge the sympathy which he really felt
towards learned institutions, and was rather
bent on obtaining a favourable award from
Oxford and the other great Universities of
Europe on the legality of his marriage. The
compliance of the Oxford Convocation was not extorted
without grievous pressure. The younger Masters of
Arts, as Wood informs us, stood firm in refusing to
sanction the divorce, and, notwithstanding a threatening
letter from the King himself, the desired vote was only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
secured, after repeated failures, by the exclusion of the
graduates in Arts from the Convocation. Soon after
this memorable but somewhat disgraceful vote, in April
1530, the King again visited Oxford, and took back into
his own hands the charters both of the University and
of the city, which had again begun to challenge academical
privileges. They were not restored until 1543,
and during the interval the University was again invited
to pronounce a solemn verdict—no longer upon a question
of private right, but on the gravest issue of national
policy ever submitted to its judgment. For by this time
the preliminary events which ushered in the English
Reformation were following each other in rapid succession.
In July 1530, the replies of several Universities
in favour of the divorce had been forwarded to the Pope
by the hand of Cranmer, and in the following March
they were laid before Parliament. In November 1530,
Cardinal Wolsey, charged with treason, died at Leicester
on his way to the Tower. At the beginning of 1531,
the clergy, having bought off the penalties of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">præmunire</i>,
were induced, under strong pressure, to acknowledge
Henry as ‘Head of the Church and Clergy, so far as the
law of Christ will allow.’ In 1532, an Act was passed
for restraining all appeals to Rome, Sir Thomas More
resigned the Chancellorship, and Henry married Ann
Boleyn. In 1533, Cranmer, having succeeded Warham
as Archbishop of Canterbury, not only pronounced the
King’s marriage with Catharine to be null and void, but
that with Anne Boleyn to be good and lawful. In 1534,
the clergy in Convocation were forbidden to make constitutions
except by the royal assent, and the Act was
passed forbidding the payment of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">annates</i> to Rome. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
the same year the formal separation of the English
Church from Rome was consummated by the great Act
25 Hen. VIII. cap. 21, which left doctrine untouched,
it is true, but abolished the authority of the Pope in
England, while it also rendered the monasteries liable
to visitation by commission under the Great Seal. In
1535, under the Act of Supremacy (26 Hen. VIII. cap.
1), the King assumed the title of ‘Supreme Head of
the Church of England’; Bishop Fisher and Sir Thomas
More were executed for denying the Royal supremacy,
and Thomas Cromwell was appointed Vicar-General of
England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Compliance
of the University
rewarded
by
Royal favour</div>

<p>It was in 1534 that the University was invited to
concur in the foregone conclusion in favour of separation
from Rome, dictated by canonists and theologians
in the King’s interest. It did so with
little hesitation, and it is probable that an
honest zeal for the independence of the
National Church mingled with less worthy motives in
eliciting the required consent. Moreover, Protestant
doctrines, propagated by some of the scholars imported
from Cambridge and the Continent, had already taken
root in Oxford soil, and several members of Cardinal
College had already undergone persecution. In the
following year a visitation of the University was instituted,
for the double purpose of establishing ecclesiastical
conformity and supplanting the old scholastic
culture by a large infusion of classical learning. The
study of the Canon Law was suppressed, and Leighton,
one of the visitors, joyfully reported that ‘Dunce’
(Duns Scotus) was ‘set in Bocardo,’ or relegated to an
academical limbo, while the leaves of scholastic manuscripts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
torn up by wholesale, might be seen fluttering
about New College quadrangle. On the other hand,
the study of Aristotle was enjoined, together with that
of the Holy Scriptures, and an important concession was
made to reward the loyalty of the University, which had
cheerfully surrendered its rights and property into the
King’s hands. It was now exempted from the payment
of tenths, or first fruits, granted by statute to the Crown,
on condition of such classical lectureships being founded
there ‘as the Kynge’s majestie shall assigne or appoynte.’
The support of these lectureships was charged upon the
five colleges supposed to be the richest, including Corpus,
where classical lectureships already existed, and the
students of the other seven colleges were directed to
attend some of the courses daily. At the same time,
following the example of his grandmother, the Countess
Margaret of Richmond, the King founded and endowed
with a yearly stipend of 40<em>l.</em> each five Regius Professorships
of Divinity, Hebrew, Greek, Medicine, and Civil
Law. The endowment was, of course, derived from the
spoils of the Church, but Henry VIII. deserves credit
for a sincere desire to promote learning. In 1532,
three years after Wolsey’s fall, he took up his great
minister’s design and refounded Cardinal College, though
on a reduced scale, under the name of King Henry the
Eighth’s College. In 1545 he dissolved it, and finally
reconstituted it under the name of Christ Church, and
in the following year transferred his new episcopal see
of Oxford from Oseney Abbey to St. Frideswide’s, blending
the collegiate with the cathedral establishment by
placing it under the control of a dean and eight canons.
We owe to Holinshed the memorable reply made by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
King to some of his courtiers who fondly hoped that he
would have dealt with University endowments, and
especially with this infant college, as he had dealt with
the monasteries. ‘Whereas wee had a regard onlie to
pull down sin by defacing the monasteries, you have a
desire also to overthrow all goodness by subversion of
colleges. I tell you, sirs, that I judge no land in
England better bestowed than that which is given to
our Universities. For by their maintenance our realme
shall be well governed when we be dead and rotten. I
love not learning so ill that I will impair the revenewes
of anie one House by a penie, whereby it may be upholden.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The first
effects of the
Reformation
injurious to
the University</div>

<p>The reason why college revenues were spared while
monastic revenues were confiscated is not difficult to
divine, without supposing that Henry VIII.
was pacified by the mediation of Catherine
Parr. The occupants of monasteries were regarded
as mercenaries of a foreign power which
had become the enemy of the monarchy; the colleges were
nurseries of the secular clergy, who had never been obnoxious
to the State, who shared to a great extent the
national spirit, and most of whom adopted the new
ecclesiastical order. The wise foresight of the founders
had excluded monks and friars as aliens from collegiate
societies; the constitution of these was mainly secular,
and their dissolution was not demanded by popular
opinion. Nevertheless, the general sense of insecurity
and habit of servility which prevailed under the despotic
rule of Henry could not but have a blighting effect on
University life. Such acts as the execution of Sir
Thomas More, one of the brightest stars of the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Renaissance, and the arbitrary restrictions imposed on
Protestantism by the Six Articles, struck at the root of
intellectual liberty, and the early stages of the Reformation
went far to depress the academical enthusiasm
kindled by the Catholic Renaissance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iconoclastic
visitation
under
Edward VI.</div>

<p>The dissolution of the monasteries, instead of aggrandising
the University, contributed to depopulate it,
since many of the poorer students, formerly
harboured in monastic houses or lodgings, or
supported by monastic exhibitions, were now
cast adrift. The Colleges and Chantries Act, though
never strictly executed, shook public confidence in
academical endowments, and at the beginning of
Edward VI.’s reign the University was far less prosperous
than it had been under Wolsey. The number of
degrees continued to fall off, and the number of halls to
dwindle, as religious controversy usurped the place of
education, and the University was used as an instrument
to advance the political or ecclesiastical aims of
the Sovereign. Henry VIII. had obtained its sanction
to his divorce and to his revolt against Rome; the
Protector Somerset and Cranmer determined to reform
it in the interests of the new Anglican Church. Several
years before, Cranmer had appointed commissions to
regulate internal discipline in two colleges of which he
was Visitor, but the Injunctions which he issued upon
their recommendation involved no change of religious
faith or ordinances. Another royal commission or
Visitation, with sweeping powers, was issued for this
purpose in 1549. A like commission was appointed
for the University of Cambridge, and the new statutes
drawn up for both Universities were framed on like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
principles, ‘in order that each eye of the nation
might be set in motion by similar muscles.’ The
‘Edwardine’ code, as it was afterwards called, was of
course so framed as to eliminate everything which
favoured Popery from the constitution of the University,
but it was not otherwise revolutionary, and, though it
soon fell into disuse, it remained nominally in force
until it was abrogated by the ‘Caroline’ statutes under
the chancellorship of Laud. But the commissioners
were not equally forbearing in their treatment of individuals,
for they proceeded to expel all academical
dignitaries found guilty of upholding the old faith. In
dealing with colleges, the spirit in which they acted was
ruthlessly iconoclastic, and not only were the old services
abolished, but altars, images, statues, ‘the things called
organs,’ and everything else which seemed to savour of
‘superstition,’ were defaced or swept away. The demolition
of the magnificent reredos in the chapel of All
Souls’ was assuredly no isolated specimen of their handiwork,
though we have no equally striking record of
Vandalism in other colleges. The amount of destruction
wrought by their orders among the libraries and chapels
of colleges cannot now be estimated, but it was certainly
enormous, and ‘cartloads’ of classical and scientific
manuscripts were consigned to the flames, together with
many an illuminated masterpiece of scholastic literature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leniency
towards
colleges</div>

<p>At the same time, while the study of canon law was
virtually suppressed, that of civil law, ancient philosophy,
Hebrew, mathematics, logic, rhetoric, and
medicine was expressly encouraged by the
Visitors. Eminent theologians were invited from the
continent, and the lectures of Peter Martyr and others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
who accepted the invitation were crowded with eager
students. It was even designed to reconstitute All
Souls’ as a college for the special cultivation of civil law,
while New College should be devoted exclusively to ‘artists.’
Many exhibitions for poor boys were suppressed,
the Magdalen Grammar School was saved only by earnest
remonstrances from the citizens, and some new dispositions
were made of college revenues with little regard to
founders’ intentions. But the spoliation does not seem
to have been so indiscriminate as Anthony Wood represents
it. The Protector Somerset, being pressed, like
Henry VIII., to sanction the general disendowment of
colleges, repelled the proposal with equal indignation;
and indeed there is some reason to believe that colleges
were now regarded with peculiar favour as seminaries
of classical learning, and comparatively free from the
scholastic and mediæval spirit which still animated the
University system. Perhaps for this reason the Visitors
forbore to exercise their power of consolidating several
colleges into one, though they did not scruple to remove
obnoxious Heads and fellows. Some of their injunctions
exhibit much good sense, and even anticipate modern
reforms, such as those which make fellowships terminable
and tenable only on condition of six months’ residence,
which insist on a matriculation-examination in grammar
and Latin, and which require that lectures shall be
followed by examinations. It is remarkable that at
Magdalen and All Souls’ one fellowship was to be reserved
for Irishmen. Others of their injunctions were
purely disciplinary, such as those which prohibit undue
expenditure on banquets after disputations, the practice
of gambling, and the use of cards in term-time. Such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
regulations point to an increase of luxury consequent on
the development of colleges, originally designed for the
poor but now frequented by a wealthier class. Polemical
divinity, stimulated by Peter Martyr’s discourses on the
Eucharist, continued to flourish; but, with this exception,
University studies were languishing, and while
foreign divines were being imported into England,
Oxford professors of civil law were emigrating to Louvain.
The non-collegiate students became fewer and
fewer; the most experienced teachers gradually disappeared;
the impulse of the Renaissance died away; the
new spirit of inquiry failed to supply the place of the
old ecclesiastical order; the attractions of trade began
to compete with those of learning, and the Universities
no longer monopolised the most promising youths in the
country who declined the profession of arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reaction
under Mary.
Martyrdom
of Ridley,
Latimer, and
Cranmer</div>

<p>The accession of Mary, in 1553, ushered in a short-lived
reaction. As the leading Romanist divines had
quitted Oxford on the proclamation of Edward
VI., so now the leading Protestants, headed
by Peter Martyr, were fain to make their
escape, though not till after Jewell had been
employed to draw up a congratulatory epistle to the
Queen, whose policy was not fully revealed at the outset
of her reign. Heads and fellows of colleges were released
from their obligation to renounce the authority
of the Pope, the Mass superseded the Common Prayer-book,
and Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, instituted a
Visitation of the three colleges under his own personal
jurisdiction. After the execution of Lady Jane Grey
and the Queen’s marriage with Philip II. the spirit of
persecution rapidly developed itself, all statutes passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
against the Papacy since the twentieth year of Henry
VIII. were repealed, the statutes passed against heretics
in the reigns of Henry IV. and Henry V. were revived,
and Oxford became the scene of those Protestant
martyrdoms which have left an indelible impression of
horror and sympathy in the English mind. Several
victims of Catholic intolerance had already perished at
the stake, when Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer were
brought to Oxford for the purpose of undergoing the
solemn farce of an academical trial, and thus implicating
the University in the guilt of their intended
condemnation. At a convocation held in St. Mary’s
Church a body of Oxford doctors was commissioned to
dispute against the Protestant bishops on the Eucharist,
in concert with a body of Cambridge doctors similarly
commissioned. The so-called ‘disputation’ took place
in the Divinity School. A day was assigned to each
prisoner, the academical judgment was of course given
against them, the judicial sentence soon followed, and
on October 15, 1555, Ridley and Latimer were led out
to be burned in Canditch, opposite Balliol College,
where a sermon was preached before the stake by Dr.
Richard Smyth on the text, ‘Though I give my body
to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me
nothing.’ Cranmer’s execution was delayed for months,
since it required the sanction of Rome, and his courage,
as is well known, gave way under the fear of death.
His recantation came too late to save his life, yet he
was called upon to repeat it in St. Mary’s Church on
his way to his doom. Instead of doing so, he publicly
retracted it before the assembled University, with earnest
professions of remorse. He was not allowed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
conclude his address, but hurried off with brutal eagerness,
to give at the stake that marvellous example of
heroic constancy which has atoned for all his past errors
in the eyes of Protestants, and crowned the martyrdoms
of the English Reformation. From that moment the
cause of the Catholic reaction was desperate in the
University, no less than in the nation. Queen Mary
conferred upon it many benefits and favours, and won
the servile homage of its official representatives, but
she never won the hearts of the students, and the news
of her death was received with no less rejoicing in
Oxford than in other parts of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visitation
and reforms
of Cardinal
Pole</div>

<p>In the meantime, however, a fresh Visitation of the
University was set on foot, in 1556, by Cardinal Pole,
who, having succeeded Gardiner as chancellor
of Cambridge in the previous year, now succeeded
Sir John Mason, the first lay chancellor
of Oxford. He was the last in that line of
cardinals, beginning with Beaufort, who, armed with
the title of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Legatus à latere</i>, assumed to govern the
English Church, as it had never been governed before,
under the direct orders of the Pope. The Visitors deputed
by him proceeded to hunt out certain obnoxious
persons who had not withdrawn from Oxford, to burn
all the English Bibles which they could find in the
common market-place, and to purge the libraries of
Protestant books. The Cardinal soon afterwards caused
the University and college statutes to be revised,
chiefly for the purpose of correcting recent innovations.
For instance, while Edward VI.’s commissioners had
authorised the use of English in college halls, Cardinal
Pole restored the old rule against speaking any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
language but Latin. It was also an avowed object of
the revision to restore the supremacy of Aristotle and
the study of scholastic philosophy. These changes,
having scarcely been effected before they were reversed,
fill less space in University annals than an incident of
comparatively trivial importance, which must have outraged
the Protestant sympathies of the Oxford townspeople.
The wife of Peter Martyr had been interred in
Christchurch Cathedral, near the relics of St. Frideswide.
Pole now directed the dean, no unwilling agent,
to exhume the body and cast it into unconsecrated
ground. The Dean improved upon his instructions by
having it buried under a dunghill, whence it was again
disinterred, mingled with the relics of St. Frideswide,
and finally committed to the grave in the year 1561.
No wonder that Queen Mary’s patronage proved a poor
substitute for academical freedom, that learning continued
to decline, that even sermons were rare and ill-attended,
that lectures were almost suspended, that few
‘proceeded’ in any of the faculties, and that it was
thought necessary to reduce the qualification of standing
for the M.A. degree in order to reinforce the University
with Masters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foundation
of Trinity
and St.
John’s
Colleges</div>

<p>Two colleges, it is true, Trinity and St. John’s, owe
their origin to Mary’s reign, and both were founded
by Roman Catholics, but upon the ruins of
monastic institutions, and before the Marian
persecutions had borne fruit in the University.
These colleges, as semi-Catholic foundations of the
Reformation era, may fitly be regarded as forming
landmarks between mediæval and modern Oxford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visitation
under
Elizabeth
and policy of
Archbishop
Parker</div>

<p class="no-indent">With the accession of Elizabeth, in November 1558,
the scenes were rapidly shifted, and the parts of the
chief actors strangely reversed. For a while,
in the quaint language of Anthony Wood,
‘two religions being now as ’twere on foot,
divers of the chiefest of the University retired
and absented themselves till they saw how affairs
would proceed.’ They had not long to wait. Though
she received graciously a deputation from the University,
headed by Dr. Tresham, canon of Christchurch,
and Dr. Raynolds, Warden of Merton, the Queen lost no
time in announcing that she intended to visit it, and
made a suspensory order in regard to all academical
elections. In June she nominated a body of Visitors to
‘make a mild and gentle, not rigorous, reformation.’
One of these Visitors was Bishop Cox, of Ely, who had
acted in a similar capacity under Edward VI., and the
Visitation was conducted on much the same principles,
except that it was less destructive. Still, compliance
with the Act of Supremacy just passed was strictly
enforced, and nine Heads of colleges, as well as the
Dean and two canons of Christchurch, proving recusants,
were ejected or forced to resign. Among these
were Raynolds and Tresham, the former of whom died
in prison. A considerable number of fellows are mentioned
as having been expelled for refusing the oath,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
but the majority conformed. Some Protestant exiles
returned from Zurich, Strasburg, and other foreign
towns, where they had suffered great privations; but it is
certain that Oxford lost many Catholic scholars whom
she could ill spare, and suffered far more from the
Elizabethan proscriptions than Cambridge, where the
Reformation had been more firmly established. Peter
Martyr and Jewell attested the intellectual and moral
degeneracy of the University at the beginning of
Elizabeth’s reign, nor could it have been otherwise after
such rapid vicissitudes in religious doctrine and ecclesiastical
government, unsettling the minds of students,
and keeping academical rulers in a constant state of
suspense or time-serving. It is certainly significant
that in the very year after the Act of Uniformity was
passed, establishing the revised Common Prayer-book,
the Queen authorised the use of a Latin version thereof
in college chapels in order to promote familiarity with
Latin. But it is probable that this, like other concessions,
was also due to a desire, which she fully shared
with Archbishop Parker, to favour the growth of an
Anglo-Catholic instead of a Puritan Church, and to
encourage the Protestants without estranging the
Romanists. Meanwhile Sampson, the dean of Christchurch,
and Humphrey, the president of Magdalen,
were zealous promoters of the Puritan movement, and
as such distrusted by the queen, especially as they were
known to be in correspondence with Geneva.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chancellorship
of
Leicester</div>

<p>In the year 1564 Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester,
became chancellor of the University, and continued
in office nearly twenty-four years. With the exception
of Sir John Mason, elected in 1552, and the Earl of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
Arundel, elected in 1558, he was the first layman who
had held this high office, which, moreover, had always
been filled by some resident member of the
University up to the year 1484. Non-resident
and courtier as he was, however, the office was no
sinecure in his hands. During his long tenure of it,
his influence made itself felt in every department of
University life, and was mainly exercised in favour of
the Puritans. For this reason, we cannot accept
Anthony Wood’s censure of him as that of an impartial
historian, nor can it be denied that he took a genuine
interest in the affairs of the University, and effected
some useful reforms. One valuable concession obtained
by the University under his chancellorship, and probably
at his instance, was its incorporation in 1571 by
an Act of Parliament, investing the ‘chancellor, masters,
and scholars’ with the rights of perpetual succession,
and confirming to it all the other privileges conferred
upon it by previous monarchs. This parliamentary
title relieved it from the necessity of seeking a new
charter from each succeeding king, and is the organic
statute by which its franchises are now secured. In the
same year an Act was passed which, supplemented by
further Acts passed five years later, has done more than
any other to save the revenues of colleges from dissipation.
The immense influx of gold from America, lowering
the value of money, had proportionately raised the
nominal value of land, and private landowners were
reaping the advantage in sales and leases. The governing
bodies of colleges, in turn, were exacting increased
fines on granting long leases at low rentals, to the
injury of their successors. The Act of 13th Elizabeth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
checked this practice by enacting that college leases
should be for twenty-one years, or three lives at most,
with a reservation of the customary rent; but means
were found to evade the Act, and it was necessary to
make it more stringent. This was done by Acts of 18th
Elizabeth, the more important of which, ‘for the maintenance
of colleges,’ is sometimes attributed to the
foresight of Sir Thomas Smith, and sometimes to that
of Lord Burghley. It requires that one-third part at
least of the rents to be reserved in college leases shall
be payable in corn or in malt, at 6<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> per quarter and
5<em>s.</em> per quarter respectively. As prices rose, this one-third
ultimately far outweighed in value the remaining
two-thirds, and became ‘a second additional endowment’
to colleges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changes in
the government
of the
University</div>

<p>Another measure of more doubtful policy was passed
by the University itself under the direct instigation of
Leicester. We have seen that in the later
Middle Ages an assembly consisting mainly of
resident teachers, and called the ‘Black Congregation,’
held preliminary discussions on University
business about to come before Convocation. In the
year 1569, the Earl of Leicester procured orders to be
framed by a delegacy and passed into statutes, whereby
it was provided that in future this preliminary deliberation
should be conducted by the Vice-chancellor, Doctors,
Heads of Houses, and Proctors. This change marks a
notable step in the growth of the college monopoly
afterwards established, and could hardly have been carried
while the monastic orders were still powerful in
Oxford, and a large body of non-collegiate students
were lodged in halls. Nor could the erection of such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
legislative oligarchy, with a virtual power of suppressing
obnoxious motions, be otherwise than unfavourable to
freedom of teaching and government, however congenial
to Tudor notions of academical discipline.
Another change made by Leicester in the same year
(1569), though dictated by a like spirit, cannot be
regarded as an innovation, but rather as the restoration
of an ancient usage. From the earliest times Chancellors
of the University had been assisted by deputies, whom
they appointed either periodically, or, more probably, as
occasion might require. By the statutes of 1549, issued
by Edward VI.’s Visitors, the right of electing these commissaries,
or ‘vice-chancellors,’ as they came to be called,
was vested in the House of Congregation. The practice
of nomination was now resumed by Leicester, and has
been maintained ever since. A somewhat opposite
tendency is to be observed in his abolition of the more
orderly but more exclusive mode of electing proctors,
which had grown up in lieu of the old tumultuous
elections by an academical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plébiscite</i>, when the proctors
represented the ‘nations.’ The nature of this restricted
election, <em>per instantes</em>, as Anthony Wood calls it, is by
no means clear; at all events, the unrestricted election
was re-established by Leicester’s influence, and continued
to produce the same disorders as ever, until it was finally
reformed in 1629.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leicester’s
administration
of the
University</div>

<p>We have abundant proofs of Leicester’s active, and
even meddlesome, interference with the details of University
and college administration. Sometimes
he recommends eminent foreigners for advancement,
or accompanies them on visits
to Oxford; sometimes he writes to urge the duty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
of encouraging more frequent University sermons;
sometimes he corrects the abuses of disorderly and
vituperative preaching by ordering that no one shall
occupy the University pulpit without undergoing a
probation in his own college; sometimes he rebukes
the license of youth in respect of costume; sometimes
he superintends the revision of University statutes by
a delegacy mainly composed of Heads of colleges; nor
must we overlook his gift to the University of a new
printing-press. But the most permanent monument of
Leicester’s chancellorship was the new test of subscription
to the Thirty-nine Articles and the Royal Supremacy,
to be required from every student above sixteen years
of age on his matriculation. This rule was doubtless
intended only to exclude the Romanising party from
the University; but its ulterior consequences, unforeseen
by its author, were mainly felt by the descendants
of the Puritans. Thenceforth the University of Oxford,
once open to all Christendom, was narrowed into an
exclusively Church of England institution, and became
the favourite arena of Anglican controversy, developing
more and more that special character, at once
worldly and clerical, which it shares with Cambridge
alone among the Universities of Europe.</p>

<p>The letter, dated 1581, in which Leicester urges
Convocation to adopt this disastrous measure, contains
other recommendations directed to the same end. One
of these is a proposal that, in order to prevent the sons
‘of knowne or suspected Papists’ being sent to Oxford
to be trained by men of the same religion, every tutor
should be licensed by a select board, to consist of the
vice-chancellor and six doctors or bachelors of divinity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
A third proposal, of which the cause is not yet obsolete,
was designed to check the conversion of professorships
into sinecures, by providing for the appointment of substitutes
where professors should fail to discharge their
duties. All these regulations, with some others of a
salutary kind, were sanctioned by decrees of Convocation,
but it is clear from a vigorous remonstrance of the
Chancellor, addressed to the University in the following
year, that most of them remained a dead letter. This
remonstrance deserves to be read, as illustrating the
difference between Leicester in his capacity of courtier
and in his capacity of University Chancellor. The
political and private character of Leicester belong to
history, and the verdict passed upon him is not likely
to be reversed; but it is difficult, after studying this
letter, to regard him as animated only by sinister and
frivolous motives in his dealings with the University.
On the other hand, there is clear evidence of wholesale
favouritism and jobbery, as it would now be called, in
his dispensation of his own patronage, and in his
repeated and underhand attempts to control the patronage
of colleges. Upon the whole, his administration of
the University was less dishonest and more statesmanlike
than might have been expected of so profligate a
politician. It cannot be compared, however, with the
wise administration of Cambridge by the great Burleigh,
and the superiority of the sister-University, both in
vital energy and in national esteem, during the Elizabethan
age, was probably due in no small degree to the
superior character of its Chancellor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Depression
of intellectual
life
in the
University</div>

<p>Other causes, however, had contributed to depress
the intellectual life of Oxford, and among these we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
not omit to notice the withdrawal of many gifted
scholars to seek liberty of conscience at the new Catholic
seminary of Douay, founded in 1568. Leicester’s
agents were constantly on the watch
against the reappearance of these ‘seminary
priests’ at Oxford with intent to Romanise the University,
and this perhaps was no imaginary danger;
but neither learning nor education flourished under
Oxford Puritanism. Writing in 1589, the year following
Leicester’s death, Whitgift fully confirms his estimate
of the laxity prevailing at Oxford. In this very
year an Act was passed to check the sale or corrupt
resignation of fellowships—evils which owed their origin
to the previous Act regulating college leases, and indirectly
encouraging a system of money allowances to
fellows, unknown in the previous century. The rise of
grammar schools, one of the earliest and best fruits of
the Reformation, seems rather to have diminished than
to have increased the demand for the higher University
culture. Formerly, when Oxford itself was a vast group
of grammar schools, many a boy who came there to learn
grammar remained there to learn philosophy or law.
Now, boys of the same class often got their schooling near
home, and then betook themselves to one of the numerous
vocations which trade and commerce were opening
to English youth in that great age of enterprise and
national expansion. Even the literature of Elizabeth’s
reign is courtly and popular rather than academical,
and Oxford contributed little to it. Bacon was a student
at Trinity College, Cambridge; Raleigh at Oriel College;
Spenser and other Elizabethan poets had received an
University education; but such men derived their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
inspiration from no academical source; their literary
powers were matured in a very different school, and
the one of their compeers whose fame eclipses all the
rest, knew Oxford only as a traveller, on his journeys
to Stratford-on-Avon. ‘Home-keeping youths,’ Shakspeare
tells us, ‘have ever homely wits,’ and the saying
is characteristic of an age in which foreign travel often
supplied the place of University education.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Encouragement
of
study by
Elizabeth,
and foundation
of the
Bodleian
Library</div>

<p>It was not until the later part of her reign that
Queen Elizabeth actively patronised Oxford culture,
and desired of the Chancellors of both the
Universities that promising scholars might be
recommended to her for promotion in Church
and State. The stimulating effect of such
patronage upon University studies very soon
made itself felt at Oxford, and men like Sir Henry
Savile were the direct product of it. A still more important
recipient of Elizabeth’s favour was Sir Thos.
Bodley, student of Magdalen and fellow of Merton, who,
having been a member of the Queen’s household, was
afterwards employed by her on missions to Germany,
France, and Belgium. Among the many benefactors
of the University his name still ranks first and highest.
In boyhood he seems to have imbibed the literary spirit
of the Renaissance under foreign instructors at Geneva,
whither his family had fled to avoid the Marian persecution;
at Merton he was one of the earliest readers in
Greek, and his long residence abroad in middle life had
quickened his scholarlike tastes. At last, at the age of
fifty-three, he deliberately took leave of State employments,
‘set up his staff at the library door’ in Oxford, and
devoted himself for the remaining fifteen years of his life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
to reconstructing and enriching the library of Duke
Humphrey. In 1602, this building, renovated and enlarged,
was opened with a solemn procession from St.
Mary’s Church, and dedicated to the use of the University.
The whole design was not completed until
after his death; but the plan of it was fully matured,
with the aid of Sir Henry Savile, by the founder, who
drew the statutes with his own hand and collected some
2,000 volumes before the opening day. This noble gift
excited the emulation of other donors, and probably did
more than any Court patronage to promote learning in
the University.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increasing
refinement
of academical
life</div>

<p>During the last seventeen years of the great Queen’s
reign the history of Oxford was unruffled by stirring
events. That Leicester’s constant remonstrances
against idleness, sinecurism, and extravagance
had not been capricious or unfounded,
is proved by the fact of their being repeated
and enforced again and again by his three successors.
It was, indeed, the misfortune of the University that it
was roused from the lethargy which oppressed it after
the Catholic reaction, only to become the battle-ground
of the Romanising and Puritan factions in the Anglican
Church. While its highest dignitaries were mostly
animated by intense party spirit rather than by zeal for
education, its students fully shared in the genial laxity of
manners, fostered by increasing luxury, which marked
the Elizabethan age. Their numbers were increased,
but the new recruits were drawn from a wealthier class;
there were more young gentlemen among them, but fewer
hardworking scholars; more of worldly accomplishments,
but less of severe and earnest study. Many of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
were destined for lay professions or even for trade, and
many tutors were now laymen, yet it may be doubted
whether there was as much real freedom of thought in the
Protestant Oxford of Elizabeth as in the Catholic Oxford
of the first three Edwards. The academical system was
narrower in principle than in mediæval times, and the
University had become a mere aggregate of colleges
and privileged halls. On the other hand, these collegiate
bodies were far more orderly and refined societies, and
learned foreigners, of whom many found a welcome
there, were impressed with the comfort and dignity of
social life at Oxford, as compared with that of continental
Universities. One of these, Albericus Gentilis, became
Regius Professor of Civil Law, and for a while revived
the waning interest of that subject, which the combined
jealousy of the clergy and common lawyers had long
discouraged as a branch of academical study.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Queen Elizabeth’s
two
visits to
Oxford</div>

<p>Queen Elizabeth twice visited Oxford in state, once
during her ‘progress’ in 1566, and again in 1592. On
the first occasion she was accompanied by
Leicester as Chancellor, and by Cecil as Secretary
of State. She was hailed with effusive
loyalty, and entertained for six days with an incessant
round of festivities, orations, disputations, and Latin
plays, which she bore with truly royal patience, winning
universal homage by ‘her sweet, affable, and noble
carriage,’ but frowning gently on divines of the Puritanical
and Romanising parties, while she reserved her
most winning smiles for the young students who amused
her with their boyish repartees, sometimes expressed in
Latin. It was not until twenty-six years later that she
revisited the University, a prematurely old woman, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
still accompanied by Cecil, now Lord Burleigh, stayed
for the same period, and went through a repetition of
the same ceremonials. This reception lacked the freshness
of the former one, yet enabled the Queen to show
that she had not forgotten either her Latinity or her
academical sympathies. According to Anthony Wood,
it was one of her objects ‘to behold the change and
amendment of learning and manners that had been in
her long absence made.’ It does not appear how far
she was satisfied in this respect, but her Latin speech
to the Heads of Houses certainly abounds in excellent
advice and professions of warm interest in the welfare
of the University. As before, she rallied the ‘precisians,’
as they were then called, on their over-zeal for
Protestantism, counselling all to study moderation and
rest content with obeying the law, instead of seeking
to be in advance of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pestilences
and disturbances
in the
sixteenth
century</div>

<p>It is remarkable how often the town of Oxford
was scourged with pestilence during the Tudor period,
and this cause had perhaps as much effect in
repelling students as the unsettled state of
ecclesiastical affairs. To check one fertile
source of infection, an order was addressed by the Privy
Council to the vice-chancellor and Heads of colleges, in
1593, forbidding the performance of plays or interludes
in Oxford or within five miles thereof, since the physicians
had connected the plague of that year with the immense
influx of players and vagrants from London into Oxford
about the Act-time. The order further directed the
University authorities to concert measures with the
mayor for the prevention of overcrowding; and these
precautions were apparently successful, for the plague<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
did not reappear in Oxford until 1603, when it was
brought thither from London shortly after the accession
of James I.</p>

<p>Scarcely less fatal to academical repose and earnest
study were the violent conflicts and riots, inherited from
the Middle Ages, which constantly recurred throughout
the sixteenth century. Some of these arose out of the
old traditional feud between the northern and southern
nations, but that feud had well-nigh died out under
Leicester’s chancellorship, and does not seem to have
influenced the keenly contested election of proctors in
1594, though we hear of a fray provoked by ‘the
troublesome Welsh’ in 1587. The contest for the
chancellorship which took place on Leicester’s death
was, in the main, one between Puritans and Episcopalians,
and the election of Hatton against Essex was a
victory for the Church of England as established by the
moderate policy of Elizabeth. Henceforth Oxford became
the stronghold of Anglicanism, and the internal
contests which divided the University were essentially
contests between rival Church parties. Meanwhile,
there was little abatement of the pettier, but still more
inveterate, jealousy between the city and the University.
Year after year this incurable enmity broke forth afresh
in some new form, and the law courts, as well as the
Chancellor, were frequently engaged in vain attempts
to keep the peace between bodies equally concerned in
the prosperity of Oxford. A temporary abatement of
these disturbances was obtained, in 1581, by the fresh
imposition of an oath to be taken by the city sheriff, on
his election, binding him to uphold the privileges of the
University; but the feud was not to be thus healed. If
we duly measure the distraction of energy which must
have resulted from such perpetual disorders, and, far
more, from the fierce religious animosities which long
convulsed Oxford and plunged other countries into civil
war—not forgetting the constant interruption of academical
residence by plague—we shall be more disposed
to marvel at the intrinsic vitality of the University than
at the many shortcomings imputed to it, when the death
of the great Queen ushered in a new and eventful period
in its history.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE UNIVERSITY UNDER JAMES I.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The University
patronised
by James I.</div>

<p class="no-indent">The influence acquired by the University of Oxford, as
a power in the State, under the Tudor dynasty, was fully
maintained by it under the Stuarts. If it
had played a humbler part in the earlier stages
of the Reformation than in the intellectual
movement of the Renaissance, and if for a while the
Protestant episcopate had been mainly recruited from
Cambridge, it was nevertheless destined to bear the
brunt of those storms which, already gathering in the
last years of Elizabeth, burst over Church and State in
the first half of the seventeenth century. Before the
accession of James I., while Church-government had
been firmly settled on an Episcopalian basis, there was
room for much latitude of opinion within the National
Church, and the religious sentiment of the English
people was strongly Puritan. This dualism was faithfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
reflected in the University, where the Act of Uniformity
was strictly enforced, and there was a growing
preponderance of academical authority on the side of
the High Church party, yet several Regius Professors of
Divinity in succession were of the Puritan school, and
a deep undercurrent of Puritanism manifested itself
again and again among the more earnest college tutors
and students. The vigorous protest of the University
against the famous Millenary petition was dictated not
so much by distrust of its Puritan authorship and tone,
as by hostility to its proposals for reducing the value of
impropriations in the hands of colleges. Little as he
understood the English nation, James I. was not slow
to appreciate the advantage of gaining a hold upon the
Universities, hastened to show a personal interest in
them, and expressed a wish to be consulted about all
academical affairs of importance. In the very year of
his accession, he granted letters patent to both Universities,
commanding each of them to choose two grave
and learned men, professing the civil law, to serve as
burgesses in the House of Commons. Though he was
prevented by the plague from visiting Oxford in that
year, he came to Woodstock in the autumn and received
the University authorities. Two years later, in 1605,
he entered Oxford on horseback, surrounded by an
imposing cavalcade of nobles and courtiers, to be received,
like Elizabeth, with costly banquets and pompous
disputations, to which, on this occasion, was added a
grand musical service in the cathedral. The pedantic
self-complacency of James enabled him to enjoy in
the highest degree all the frivolous solemnities of this
academic ceremonial, of which a full account has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
preserved in the ‘Rex Platonicus’ of the Public Orator,
Sir Isaac Wake. It is remarkable that Anthony Wood
dates the progress of luxury, with drinking in taverns
and other disorders, from the festivities lavished on this
visit. The king gave a further proof of his confidence
in Oxford, by entering his son Prince Henry, a youth
of great promise, who died prematurely in 1612, as a
student at Magdalen College.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James I.’s
attitude towards
the
University
and the
Church</div>

<p>Whatever may be thought of James I.’s character,
it is certain that he was animated by a generous
partiality for the Universities, not only as
bulwarks of his throne but as seats of learning.
It is equally certain that he entered
upon his reign with serious and practical intentions
of Church reform. Accordingly, in 1603, he
addressed letters to the Chancellors of Oxford and Cambridge,
pointing out the evils and abuses resulting from
the wholesale diversion of Church revenues, by means of
impropriation, to private aggrandisement. He declared
himself ready to sacrifice all the patronage which had
thus devolved upon the Crown, and called upon the
colleges to imitate his example by re-endowing their
benefices with tithes for the support of efficient ministers.
He was dissuaded from carrying out his purpose by the
remonstrances of Archbishop Whitgift and others, but
in 1606, after the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot,
the Universities received a valuable gift in the right
of presenting to all benefices in the hands of Roman
Catholic patrons, the southern counties being assigned
to Oxford, the northern to Cambridge. They were also
formally exempted from liability to subsidies on three
separate occasions. In such proofs of partiality for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
Universities James was but following out the policy of
Elizabeth, who had clearly grasped the expediency of
controlling and conciliating the great seminaries in
which the national clergy were educated. At first his
native Calvinism inclined him to favour the Puritans,
whose influence in the University had been greatly
strengthened by the example and teaching of the admirable
Laurence Humphrey, President of Magdalen,
and Regius Professor of Divinity, who died in 1589.
But he gradually discovered the natural affinity between
Arminian theories of Church authority and his own
theories of kingcraft, as well as the preponderance of
the former in the clerical order, and decisively cast in
his lot with the High Church party. In the grand
struggle between the ecclesiastical courts and the
common law judges, the Universities with the great body
of the clergy supported the King and the archbishop in
sustaining the authority of the former. They were
again associated with the King when he conferred a
lasting benefit on the English Church and nation by
initiating the Authorised Version of the Bible. In this
great work the two Universities were represented almost
equally, and among the Oxford scholars engaged in it
we find seven Heads of colleges and four other divines,
who afterwards became bishops. There is some reason,
however, to believe that he cherished a preference for
the sister University, and it is a somewhat remarkable
fact that George Carleton, afterward bishop of Chichester,
was the only Oxford man among the five academical
divines selected by him to represent England at
the Synod of Dort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rise and influence
of
Laud</div>

<p>In the year 1603, we first hear of ‘Mr. William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
Laud, B.D. of St. John’s College,’ as proctor; in 1606
he again comes under notice, as preaching in St. Mary’s
Church, and ‘letting fall divers passages
savouring of popery,’ which brought him
under the censure of the vice-chancellor. Thenceforth
he became a formidable power, and ultimately the
ruling spirit in the University, the discipline of which
he persistently laboured to reform. The eighteen years
which elapsed between his proctorship and his retirement
from the presidency of St. John’s, in 1621, were
crowded with events memorable in the history of the
English Church. The failure of the Hampton Court
Conference, in 1604, drove the Puritan party, at last,
into active opposition. The canons enacted in the Convocation
of the same year compelled the clergy to subscribe
the Three Articles which the Parliament of 1571
had expressly refused to impose upon them; and the
immediate consequence was the deprivation of three
hundred clergymen. In 1606, the severity of the laws
against Popish recusants was increased, and the arbitrary
jurisdiction of the High Commission was constantly
extended until it was openly challenged by the common
law judges. The responsibility of supporting the king
in this aggression on the Constitution rests, in part, on
Abbot, formerly Master of University College, whom the
Calvinistic party at Oxford had regarded as their protector
against Laud and his associates, but who, after
succeeding Bancroft as archbishop in 1610, strained the
powers of the High Commission almost as far as Bancroft
himself. There was no such inconsistency in Laud,
who, from the first, deliberately set himself to undo the
work of Leicester as Chancellor, and Humphrey as professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
of divinity at Oxford. An appeal was lodged
against him by the opposite party when he was elected
President of St. John’s in 1611, but the election was
confirmed. It was he who procured the publication, in
1616, of a stringent order from the king, by the advice
of the clergy in convention, for the subscription of the
Three Articles in the Thirty-sixth Canon by every candidate
for a degree, for strict attendance on University
sermons, and for the enforcement of other safeguards
against heterodoxy. This was not the first time that the
Convocation of the clergy had presumed to meddle with
the government of the University, for another canon,
passed in 1604, had required surplices to be worn in
college chapels. But, of course, such decrees could only
be enforced by the action of the Crown, the validity of
whose jurisdiction over the Universities was, in itself,
somewhat doubtful. In this case, the authority of the
Chancellor, the Earl of Pembroke, was employed to obtain
compliance with the order which, though resented
by many, was obeyed. In 1622, the University Convocation
gave a further proof of obsequious loyalty, not
only by publicly burning the works of Paræus, in deference
to a mandate of the Privy Council, but also by
passing a declaratory resolution absolutely condemning
resistance to a reigning sovereign, offensive or defensive,
upon any pretext whatever. This solemn affirmation of
the doctrine of passive obedience was the more significant
and ignoble, because it came but a few months
after the Commons had recorded a solemn protest against
the violation of their liberties, and the king had torn it
out of their Journal with his own hand. The progress
of Arminianism in the Church and University kept pace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
with that of personal government in the State. It was
in 1622 that Coke, Pym, Selden, and others were imprisoned
for disputing the royal prerogative, and from
this year Anthony Wood dates ‘such an alteration in
the University, that the name of Calvin (which had
carried all before it) began to lessen by degrees.’ In
the great crisis of the next reign it was found that
Oxford Puritanism was by no means extinct, but the
reactionary creed of Laud had almost exclusive possession
of the University pulpit, and soon become dominant.
This new faith, half political, half theological, and affirming
at once the divine right of kings and the divine
right of bishops, found partial expression in James’s own
maxim—‘No bishop, no king.’ Absolutism allied itself
naturally with the doctrinal system of Arminianism; the
creed of Laud, embraced long ago by the fatuous King
and the Court, had already been adopted deliberately by
Prince Charles; it was now to become the official creed
of Oxford for nearly two generations.</p>

Colleges</div>

<p>During the whole reign of James I. the external
condition of the University was prosperous, and it received
important accessions, both in buildings
and endowments. On March 30, 1619, the
day following the burial of Sir Thomas Bodley
in Merton College Chapel, the first stone of
the New Schools, as they were then called,
was laid by his coadjutor, Sir John Bennett. Two
colleges, Wadham and Pembroke, owe their origin to
the same period. The former was founded in 1610 by
Dorothea, widow of Nicholas Wadham, under a royal
licence; the latter was founded in 1624 by James I.
himself, but endowed at the cost and charges of Thomas
Tesdale and Richard Wightwick. No less than six
professorships were instituted during the same period.
The first two of these—the professorships of geometry
and astronomy—bear the name of their founder, Sir
Henry Savile, warden of Merton College, who endowed
them in 1619. In the quaint language of Anthony
Wood: ‘Beholding the Mathematick Studies to be
neglected by the generality of men, ’twas now his
desire to recover them, least they should utterly sink
into oblivion.’ These benefactions, and the growing
wealth of colleges, helped to strengthen the University
in the esteem of the upper classes, upon which it now
depended for its supply of students. According to a
census taken in 1611, the number of residents was
2,420, and it continued to increase until the outbreak of
the Civil War.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE UNIVERSITY UNDER CHARLES I. AND LAUD.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
at Oxford</div>

<p class="no-indent">The death of James I. and the succession of Charles I.
produced no break in the continuity either of national
or of academical history. With less shrewdness
than his father, but more of dignity in
his character and bearing, Charles possessed equal
obstinacy, and equally regarded it as his mission to
curtail the liberties of his people, in the interests of the
Crown, by the aid of the new State Church. The
profligate and unscrupulous Buckingham retained all
his ascendency, and was Charles’s trusted confidant in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
politics. Abbot was still Archbishop of Canterbury,
and crowned the young King in Westminster Abbey,
while Laud officiated as Dean of Westminster. But
Laud was Charles’s real adviser in Church affairs, and
his evil counsels soon brought about the disgrace of his
rival, Abbot, when the archbishop, reverting to his
earlier principles, boldly opposed the arbitrary and
oppressive policy of the Court. Though he was no
longer president of St. John’s College, his influence
over the academical body was never relaxed, and was
constantly exercised on behalf of Arminianism in the
Church, and absolutism in the State. It was some
time, however, before the University was directly
affected by the storms which clouded the political
horizon from the very beginning of Charles’s reign. His
first Parliament, it is true, was adjourned to Oxford in
the Long Vacation of 1625, on account of the plague
then raging in London, and all the colleges and halls
were cleared, by order of the Privy Council, for the
reception of the members. The Privy Council itself
met at Christchurch, the House of Commons sat in the
divinity school, and the Lords ‘in the north part of the
picture gallery,’ but the Parliament, having refused to
grant supplies, was dissolved within a fortnight. The
plague, however, had followed it to Oxford, and the
commencement of Michaelmas term had to be postponed
until November 9. In 1628 the election of proctors
was attended with more than ordinary tumult; the
Chancellor intervened, and ultimately the King took the
matter into his own hands, referring the decision of it
to a committee, including Laud, who practically dictated
their nominees to the University Convocation. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
February 1629, the House of Commons, which had
obtained the King’s assent to the Petition of Right, took
upon itself, by a letter from the Speaker, to call for a
return of all persons known to have contravened the
Articles of Religion. The proctors so far recognised
the validity of the order as to institute an inquiry, but
Parliament was prorogued not long afterwards, and the
question seems to have dropped. The incident, however,
is not without its importance, as indicating the
disposition of Parliament, now roused into active opposition,
to share with the Crown the control of the University.
On August 27 in the same year, Charles I.,
during his stay at Woodstock, paid his first state
visit to Oxford, and was entertained with his queen in
Merton College, where she was destined to be lodged so
long during the Civil War, of which the premonitory
signs were already visible to far-sighted observers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chancellorship
of Laud</div>

<p>In April 1630, the Earl of Pembroke died, and
Laud, now bishop of London, was elected Chancellor
of the University by a very narrow majority
over Philip, Earl of Montgomery, Pembroke’s
younger brother. His chancellorship lasted eleven
years, and was terminated by his resignation in 1641.
However narrow may have been his Church policy, he
was a true and loyal son of the University, by which he
deserves to be remembered as an earnest reformer and
liberal benefactor. It was at his instance that in 1629,
the year before he became Chancellor, a final end was
put to the riotous election of proctors which had so
often disgraced the University for centuries. This was
effected by the simple device of constructing a cycle,
extending over twenty-three years, within which period<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
a certain number of turns was assigned to each college,
according to its size and dignity. The inventor of this
cycle was Peter Turner, of Merton, a great mathematician
in his day, and it fulfilled its object by entrusting the
nomination of proctors to individual colleges, each of
which could exercise a deliberate choice, instead of leaving
it to be fought out by the academical democracy. This
salutary change was accepted by the University Convocation
on the recommendation of the king and the Earl of
Pembroke, but its real originator was Laud. His efforts to
reform the discipline and morals of the University were
equally well meant, though conceived in an almost
Puritanical spirit which might have won the approval
of the ‘Precisians,’ who hated him so bitterly, and not
without good cause. These efforts extended to the
colleges of which he was Visitor, and were carried to the
length of minutely regulating every detail of University
life. Attendance at sermons and services, the conduct of
disputations in theology and arts, the relations between
Masters of Arts and Bachelors or students, the forms
and fashions of academical costume, the proper length of
scholars’ hair, the hours of meals, the custody of college
gates, the presentation to college benefices, the management
of college property, the use of Latin in conversation
as well as formal business, the enforcement of purity in
elections to fellowships—such are some of the academical
concerns which received from Laud as careful attention
as the highest interests of the Church and the monarchy.
In one respect, indeed, the policy of Laud strongly resembled
that of Leicester, for both maintained their
influence by favouritism, and kept up a regular correspondence
with confidential agents at Oxford, through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
whom they were informed of everything that passed
there. But while Leicester’s inquisitorial vigilance was
directed not only against disturbers of the peace but
against persons suspected of Romanism, that of Laud
was directed against Puritans and Calvinists.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Compilation
of Laudian
Statutes</div>

<p>The greatest and most permanent result of Laud’s
chancellorship was the compilation of the famous code,
known as the ‘Laudian’ or ‘Caroline’ Statutes,
which continued to govern the University for
more than two centuries. From time immemorial, the
University had claimed and exercised the power of
making, repealing, and revising its own statutes.
Under the chancellorship of Archbishop Warham, in
1513, this power had been delegated to a committee of
seven, and again, in 1518, it was delegated to Cardinal
Wolsey, in spite of the Chancellor’s protest; but in
both cases, it was the University Congregation which
conferred the commission, under which, however, very
little seems to have been done. The commissioners
of Edward VI. were appointed under the Great Seal,
and drew up the ‘Edwardine Statutes,’ by virtue of
an authority independent of the University. Cardinal
Pole, on the contrary, issued his Ordinances, in his
capacity of Chancellor, provisionally only, until a delegacy
of Convocation should decide upon the necessary
alterations. Similar delegacies were appointed by the
authority of Convocation, as it was then called, on several
occasions during the reign of Elizabeth; and though
in the reigns of her two successors many ordinances
were sent down by the Crown, they were not accepted
as operative until they had been embodied in statutes,
or adopted in express terms by Convocation. Even in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
1628, when the proctors had endeavoured to obstruct
the proposed statutes regulating proctorial elections,
and the king threatened with his condign displeasure
those who should persist in opposing them, Convocation
went through the form of enacting them by its own
decree. The same course was taken in 1629, under
Lord Pembroke’s chancellorship, but at Laud’s instigation,
when the delegacy was nominated to codify the
statutes, which then lay, as Laud said, ‘in a miserable
confused heap.’ The work occupied four years, and,
when it was completed, the University placed the new
code in the hands of Laud, with full power to make
additions or alterations. He corrected the draught, and
in July 1634 directed a copy to be deposited in each
college or hall for a year, during which amendments
might be suggested. At last, in June 1636, Laud
finally promulgated, and the King solemnly confirmed,
the ‘Corpus Statutorum,’ as they were officially designated,
and the University Convocation formally accepted
them, with the most fulsome professions of gratitude to
its Chancellor, and of confidence in the eternity of their
own legislation. This confidence was not, and could
not be, justified by events; but an impression long prevailed
that the Laudian statutes, though capable of
extension, were as incapable of alteration as the laws
of the Medes and Persians. It is, indeed, very remarkable
that, with a few trifling additions, these statutes
proved capable of being worked practically until they
were superseded, in many essential particulars, by the
University Reform Act of 1854.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Main
provisions of
the Laudian
Statutes</div>

<p>These statutes were for the most part, a digest of
those already in force, but embodied also new regulations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
of great importance, such as those for the government
of the University by the ‘Hebdomadal Board,’
for the election of proctors according to the
cycle recently established, for the nomination
of ‘collectors’ (to preside over ‘determinations’),
and for the conduct of public examinations.
The principle of placing the main control of academical
affairs in the hands of heads of colleges and halls had
already been established by Leicester, but it was now
reduced to a fundamental law, and the vice-chancellor,
with the Heads of Houses and proctors, was formally
entrusted with the whole administration of the University.
This statute effectually stereotyped the administrative
monopoly of the colleges, and destroyed
all trace of the old democratic constitution which had
been controlled only by the authority of the mediæval
Church. The same oligarchical tendency may be
discerned in the statute which converted the popular
and public election of proctors by the common suffrages
of all the Masters into a private election by the Doctors
and Masters of a certain standing in each college, however
beneficial its effect may have been in checking the
abuses of tumultuous canvassing. While the dignity of
the procuratorial office was thus sensibly reduced, that
of the vice-chancellor’s office was proportionably enhanced.
The Laudian Code legalised the practice resumed
by Leicester, directing that the vice-chancellor
should be nominated annually from the heads of colleges
by the Chancellor, with the assent of Convocation. As
vicegerent of the Chancellor, and chairman of the Hebdomadal
Board, he gradually acquired a position of
greater authority and independence than had formerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
belonged to him. Under Laud’s chancellorship, indeed,
he was expected to make a weekly report to his chief on
the state of the University; but later Chancellors were
neither so conscientious nor so meddlesome, and, in
default of urgent necessity for their intervention, were
at last content to be regarded as ornamental personages,
rather than as the actual rulers of the University. One
of the vice-chancellor’s chief duties at this period was
to guard the orthodoxy of the University pulpit, and
there are numerous instances of preachers being summoned
before him for controverting Arminian doctrines,
and forced to sign humble recantations of their errors.
Where they proved refractory, the royal prerogative
was promptly invoked to coerce them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Studies and
examinations
under
the Laudian
Statutes</div>

<p>The course of study, and standard of examination,
prescribed by the Laudian statutes were so much
beyond the requirements of later times that
we may well doubt whether either can have
been strictly enforced. The B.A. degree,
which then concluded the first stage of an academical
career, might be taken at the end of the fourth
year, and the student was bound to have attended
lectures in grammar, rhetoric, the Ethics, Politics,
and Economics of Aristotle, logic, moral philosophy,
geometry, and Greek. In order to attain the M.A.
degree, three more years were to be spent in studying
geometry, astronomy, metaphysics, natural philosophy,
Greek, and Hebrew. Making every allowance
for the longer residence of those days, as well as for
the lower conception of proficiency in these subjects,
we cannot but admire the comprehensive range of this
curriculum, and admit that if it was actually accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
by a majority of students, the race of passmen
in the seventeenth century must have been cast in an
heroic mould. Disputations, which had long fallen
into discredit, were now superseded by a system of
public examinations, the germs of which are to be found
in an obsolete statute of 1588, if not in the earlier
statutes of Edward VI. The examinations for the B.A.
and M.A. degrees, respectively, were to be in the subjects
in which the candidates were statutably bound to
have previously heard lectures, and special regard was
to be paid to fluency in Latin, but they can scarcely
have been effective according to modern ideas. They
were to be conducted, in rotation, by all the regent
masters, under the orders of the senior proctor; the
method of interrogation seems to have been exclusively
oral; and the authority of Aristotle was to be paramount
within the whole sphere of his voluminous writings. As
the ordinary period of residence waxed shorter, and the
University relaxed its authority over its own teachers,
the examination system of Laud, though it nominally
survived for more than a century and a half, became
almost as illusory as the old scholastic disputations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Services of
Laud to the
University</div>

<p>The effusive gratitude manifested by the University
towards Laud, on the publication of his ‘Caroline’ statutes,
was partly, no doubt, the expression of party
spirit, but it was also justified by his great
services. He presented to the Library a splendid collection
of Oriental manuscripts, besides procuring valuable
gifts of literary treasures from others; he founded and
endowed the professorship of Arabic; he persuaded the
King to annex canonries of Christchurch to the professorship
of Hebrew and the office of Public Orator—which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
last grant was never confirmed by Parliament; he
obtained for the University the right of printing Bibles,
hitherto the monopoly of the King’s printers; and he
secured for it a new charter extending all its ancient
liberties and privileges. Two important acquisitions
made by the University under the chancellorship of
Laud are not known to have been specially due to his
initiative. The earlier of these was the foundation of
the Botanic Gardens in 1632, though its completion was
delayed by the Civil War. The Convocation House,
adjoining the Divinity School, was begun in 1634 and
finished in 1638, with an extension of the Bodleian
Library above it, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apodyterium</i> at its north end,
where the Chancellor’s Court is still held. It was first
used in October 1638. By this time, if we may trust
Anthony Wood, the University had recovered its popularity,
and numbered at least 4,000 scholars. No
wonder that loyal sons of Oxford looked back with fond
regret to Laud’s chancellorship during the evil days of
the Civil War and the Commonwealth. Nor should it
be forgotten that if his intolerance of schism made him
a persecutor of the Puritans, he also set himself to
exclude Romish priests from the University; or that he
reconverted Chillingworth to Anglicanism, and rewarded
with a canonry the learning of John Hales, whose views
of Church government conflicted greatly with his own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Last five years
of Laud’s
chancellorship</div>

<p>Though Laud continued to preside over the University
until 1641, the glory of his chancellorship was
crowned by a solemn visit of the King and
Queen to Oxford at the end of August
1636. This visit lasted three days, and was attended
by all the usual ceremonials, including the performance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
of comedies at Christchurch, and St. John’s, Laud’s
own college. The Elector Palatine and his brother, the
famous Prince Rupert, received honorary M.A. degrees
on this occasion. After this it may well be imagined
that Laud had little or no leisure for academical cares
until his resignation of the chancellorship by a pathetic
letter dated from the Tower on June 26, 1641. Within
this interval of five years, the great controversy about
the payment of ship-money had come to a head; judgment
had been given against John Hampden; Prynne,
Burton, and Eastwick had been condemned to the pillory
for their writings; Charles’s fourth Parliament had met
after eleven years of personal government and been
promptly dissolved; the Scotch army, after halting on
the border in 1639, had invaded Yorkshire in 1640;
the High Commission Court had been closed for ever;
the Long Parliament had commenced its sittings, and
impeached both Strafford and Laud; the Triennial Act
had been passed; the bishops had been excluded from
the House of Lords; the King had agreed that Parliament
should not be adjourned or dissolved without its
own consent; Strafford had been executed; and the
‘Root and Branch Bill’ for the abolition of Episcopacy
had been read in the Commons. Nevertheless, Laud had
found time for close and constant attention to University
and college business. It was in 1638 that he instituted
a regular examination for the B.A. and M.A. degrees. In
1639, he sent another donation of books, gave stringent
directions for the repression of disorders in the Convocation
House, and made special efforts to put down
drinking parties in colleges and halls, which had come
into vogue, since ‘the scholars (not excepting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
seniors) had been hunted out of alehouses and taverns
by the vice-chancellor and proctors constant walking’—a
result of his own disciplinary vigour. In November
1640, he sent his last present of books, pleading a want
of leisure, for the first time, in excuse for the brevity of
his letter. He was now in the hands of his enemies,
and it was freely alleged in the House of Commons that,
through his influence, the University was infected with
Popery. Accordingly, on December 14, a statement
was drawn up and signed by all the Heads of Houses,
except Rogers, Principal of New Inn Hall, declaring
‘that they knew not any one member of this University
guilty of, or addicted to, Popery.’ Parliament, however,
ordered the books and registers of the University to be
sent up to London, with a view of extracting materials
from the Acts of Convocation to serve as evidence
against Laud. Among the offences imputed to him at
his trial, several related specially to his administration
of the University. He was accused of causing old crucifixes
to be repaired and new ones to be set up; of
turning Communion tables ‘altarwise,’ railing them in,
and enjoining that obeisance should be made to them;
of encouraging the use of copes; of instituting Latin
prayers in Lent; of introducing superstitious processions;
above all, of erecting ‘a very scandalous statue
of the Virgin Mary, with Christ in her arms,’ over the
new porch of St. Mary’s Church. Some of these
alleged acts were denied by the archbishop; others
were admitted and defended as consistent with the
received doctrine of the Church. Perhaps none of them
would be regarded by an impartial critic of Laud’s trial
as heinous enough to sustain a charge of high treason,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
or, indeed, as having any bearing whatever on such a
charge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eminent
members of
the University
in the
generation
preceding
the Civil
Wars</div>

<p>Whatever may have been the shortcomings of
Oxford in the generation which preceded the Civil War,
it certainly produced a number of men whose
learning and piety might have adorned a
happier and more peaceful age. Among the
Heads of colleges who held office under Laud’s
short chancellorship were John Prideaux, Sir
Nathaniel Brent, Gilbert Sheldon, Brian Duppa, Samuel
Fell, and Juxon, and while the headships of colleges
were filled by such men as these, others not less
eminent represented the University in other capacities.
In his rectory at Penshurst, and afterwards in his rooms
at Christchurch, Hammond was maturing a theological
knowledge which has placed him among standard
English divines; Bainbridge was prosecuting at Merton
important researches in astronomical science; Earle,
afterwards tutor to Prince Charles, and bishop of Salisbury,
was serving in the office of senior proctor; Selden
was acting as burgess for the University; and Brian
Twyne was amassing those antiquarian stores which
supplied the most valuable materials for the marvellous
industry of Anthony Wood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">University
life in the
generation
preceding
the Civil
Wars</div>

<p>The characteristic features of University life in the
period immediately preceding the Civil War contrasted
equally with those which had distinguished
it in the Middle Ages and those which distinguish
it in the present day. The academical
community had become far less democratic
and more outwardly decorous since the suppression of
‘chamber-dekyns,’ and the concentration of all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
students into colleges and halls. The Heads of colleges,
invested with special privileges and absolute control
over University legislation, were now permanently
resident, and had greater power of keeping good order
than had ever belonged to the proctors, vainly striving
to enforce discipline among thousands of beggarly
non-collegiate students. On the other hand, there was
less unity in college society; for, while Bachelor fellows
were still an inferior grade, and bound to ‘cap’ Master
fellows in the quadrangles, a new class of ‘commoners’
had sprung up, mostly consisting of richer men, and
holding aloof from members of the foundation. ‘Town
and gown rows’ were not unknown, and the ancient
jealousy between the city and the University was intensified
by the growth of religious and political
differences; but the peace was far better kept, and the
streets of Oxford were no longer the scene of sanguinary
affrays. Whether the morality of the students was essentially
improved is open to more doubt. Judging by the
constant repetition of censures on their conduct from
chancellors and Visitors, we might infer that Oxford was
quite demoralised. After all, however, most of these censures
are not so much directed against grave offences as
against extravagance in dress and breaches of academical
decorum, and it is impossible not to suspect that over-regulation
had something to do with the perverse neglect
of rules among undergraduates. It is the variety of legitimate
outlets for youthful spirits and energy which in
modern times has been found the best antidote for youthful
vices, and if we realise the conditions of undergraduate
society in the earlier part of the seventeenth century,
we shall rather be disposed to wonder at the standard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
of virtue being so high as it seems to have been. One
of these conditions was the overcrowding of colleges due
to the disappearance of hostels. Where two or three
students habitually shared the same room, and a poor
scholar rarely enjoyed the comfort of a bed to himself,
unless it were a truckle-bed in his patron’s chamber,
the self-respect and graceful courtesy which is now
traditional among well-bred young Englishmen at the
University could scarcely be cultivated at all. The
tutorial system already existed in colleges, and the
personal relations thus established between tutors and
pupils were sometimes productive of very beneficial
results; but outside these relations there was little
sympathy and kindly intercourse between members of
different colleges or different classes in the same college.
Manly sports were not unknown, but they were chiefly
of the rougher sort, and discouraged by the authorities.
We hear little of boating, or even of riding, and cricket
had not yet been invented, but football was vigorously
played, and led to so many warlike encounters between
the combatants that it was regarded with little favour
by vice-chancellors. Archery was still practised, as
well as quoits, and ninepins or skittles, but these
last games were coupled with bull-baiting, bear-baiting,
cock-fights, common plays, and public shows, in
official warnings to undergraduates against unlawful
pastimes. Even James I., who prided himself on his
‘Book of Sports’ as much as on his invectives against
tobacco, issued royal letters condemning them, apparently
because, though not intrinsically evil, they brought
great crowds of people together, who might break out
into disorder. In short, it may safely be said that an
Oxford student in the reigns of James I. and Charles I.
had less recognised liberty than a public-school boy in
the reign of Victoria, the natural result of which was
that he was all the more disposed to rebel against
discipline. Meanwhile his studies, though mainly
classical in their subjects, and mainly conducted within
the walls of his college, were largely scholastic in
their methods. The University was still, above all, a
training-school for the clerical profession rather than
for the general world.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE UNIVERSITY DURING THE CIVIL WARS, AND THE
SIEGE OF OXFORD.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The University
sides
with the
King and the
Church</div>

<p class="no-indent">The part to be taken by the University of Oxford in the
great national struggle now impending was never for a
moment doubtful. Throughout its history it
had loyally acknowledged not merely the supremacy
of the Crown, in its capacity of paramount
Visitor, but the jurisdiction of the High Commission
and other exertions of the prerogative lately
challenged by the Commons, while it stood committed
by its own solemn vote to the doctrine of passive
obedience. It was still more closely identified with the
Church. Its property had always been treated in ancient
times as ecclesiastical, being constantly taxed by votes
of the Convocation of Canterbury, and constantly exempted,
by royal letters, from taxes payable on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
lands and tenements of laymen. Its representatives
had attended the great Councils of the Western Church;
its Chancellor had always been a great ecclesiastic until
the Reformation; nearly all the Visitors of its colleges
were still great ecclesiastics; and the recent imposition
of test-oaths, including those prescribed by a purely
ecclesiastical canon, on all its students, coupled with the
clerical restrictions on most college fellowships, had
effectually rendered it an integral part of the Anglican
Church. No doubt, it contained a strong Puritan element
which sympathised with the Parliament, but the
overwhelming majority were heartily on the side of the
Church and the King, and proved themselves capable of
great sacrifices for the cause which they espoused. The
first overt act of the University in support of these
principles was taken on April 24, 1641, in the form of
a ‘Petition made to the high and honourable Court of
Parliament in behalf of Episcopacy and Cathedralls.’
This petition was accompanied by another to the same
effect, bearing the signatures of almost all the resident
graduates, and derives additional significance from its
date. But a few months before, the canons lately passed
by the Convocation of Canterbury had been declared
illegal by the Commons, and the Bill to exclude bishops
from the House of Lords had just been introduced.
Nevertheless, the University did not hesitate to press
upon Parliament, now in no placable mood, the duty of
maintaining not only ‘the ancient and Apostolicall Order’
of bishops, but also ‘those pious Foundations of Cathedrall
Churches, with their Lands and Revenewes.’ Some
of the reasons alleged in support of the petition are grave
and weighty; others, if less solid, are still more interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
as indications of the light in which Church preferments
were then regarded by University graduates.
For instance, cathedral endowments are extolled ‘as the
principal outward motive of all Students, especially in
Divinitie, and the fittest reward of some deep and
eminent Scholars; as affording a competent portion in
an ingenuous way to many younger Brothers of good
Parentage who devote themselves to the Ministery of
the Gospell; as the onely meanes of subsistence to a
multitude of Officers and other Ministers, who with their
families depend upon them; as the maine Authors or
Upholders of divers Schooles, Hospitalls, Highwaies,
Bridges, and other publique and pious works; as the
cheife support of many thousand families of the Laity,
who enjoy faire estates from them in a free way; and
as funds by which many of the learned Professors in our
University are maintained.’ It was hardly to be expected
that such arguments should prevail with Pym
and Hampden, Prynne and Holles; nor can we be surprised
to learn that ‘the answer to it was very inconsiderable.’
It was, however, presented to the King on
the following day, and his reply, preserved by Anthony
Wood, is memorable as showing how resolutely he linked
the fortunes of his Crown with those of the Church. He
declared openly that he knew the clergy were suffering
because of their fidelity to him, protested that he would
rather feed on bread and water than ‘mingle any part
of God’s patrimonie with his owne revenewes;’ insisted
that ‘Learning and Studies must needs perish if the
honors and rewards of Learning were destroyed;’ and
predicted that ‘Monarchy would not stand long if the
Hierarchy perish.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Commons
issue
an order for
the University</div>

<p>Within a month after the presentation of this petition
Strafford had been executed, and the ‘Root and
Branch Bill’ for the complete abolition of
Episcopacy had been read in the Commons.
Two months later (July 1641) the Courts of
Star Chamber and High Commission, with the arbitrary
jurisdiction of the King’s Council, had ceased to exist.
On November 22 the ‘Grand Remonstrance’ was passed,
containing an elaborate indictment against the Crown for
all the unconstitutional acts committed since the beginning
of the reign, and an appeal to the people of England.
Then followed in quick succession the King’s attempt to
arrest the five members in the House of Commons, his
final departure from London, his refusal to place the
custody of fortified places and the command of the
militia in the hands of the Parliament, the levy of forces
on both sides, the rejection by the King of an ultimatum
sent by the Parliament, and the erection of the royal
standard at Nottingham, on August 22, 1642. Of these
momentous events the University was, of course, a mere
spectator; but the House of Commons found leisure, in
the midst of its preparations for war, to guard its own
interests at Oxford. On June 28, 1641, it issued an
order purporting to abolish the obligation of subscription
to the Three Articles of the Thirty-sixth Canon, as well
as that of doing reverence to the Communion-table, which
seems to have been enjoined in some of the colleges.
This order was actually read in Convocation, and was
followed in February 1642 by the receipt of a ‘Protestation,’
which the Speaker, in the name of the House, called
upon the vice-chancellor and Heads of colleges to take
and impose upon all members, and even servants, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
University, being of the age of eighteen years and upwards.
This Protestation, conceived in a moderate tone,
bound the subscriber to uphold Protestantism and the
union between the three kingdoms of England, Scotland,
and Ireland. As it contained a profession of allegiance
to the Crown, as well as of respect for the power and
privileges of Parliament, it was generally signed, though
many loyal Protestants objected to it as dictated by a
party on the verge of rebellion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contribution
for the
King’s service,
and
first occupation
of
Oxford by
Parliamentary
troops</div>

<p>In the summer of 1642, war, though not actually
declared, was felt to be inevitable, and both the king and
the Parliament were already raising supplies
for the autumn campaign. On July 7, Charles
I., then at York, addressed a requisition to
Prideaux, as vice-chancellor, inviting the
colleges to contribute money for his service by
way of loan at eight per cent. interest, alleging that
similar aid had already been received by his enemies.
Convocation immediately voted away all the reserve
funds in Savile’s, Bodley’s, and the University chest,
but it does not appear that any contributions of plate
were made by the colleges on this occasion. On July
12, Parliament issued an order declaring this requisition
illegal, and directing watch and guard to be set on all
highways about Oxford; but it appears from a letter of
the king, dated from Beverley on July 18, that a large
subsidy had then reached him. At the same time, he
addressed letters to the Commissioners of Array for the
county, the high sheriff, and the mayor of Oxford, specially
requesting them to protect the University in case
of attack. In the middle of August several hundred
graduates and students enrolled themselves, in accordance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
with a royal proclamation, and were regularly
drilled in the ‘New Park.’ On August 28, a troop
of Royalist horse, under Sir John Byron, entered the
city, and the volunteers were virtually placed under his
orders, with the apparent consent of the citizens, who,
however, did not raise a similar corps for the defence
of their own walls. On September 1, a delegacy of
thirty members, including the vice-chancellor and
proctors, and popularly called ‘The Council of War,’
was appointed for the purpose of arming the scholars
and provisioning the Royal troops. But the resolution
of the University was shaken when it was discovered,
on September 9, that the citizens were in communication
with the Parliament, and that a Parliamentary force
was about to move on Oxford from Aylesbury. Indeed,
the University went so far as to despatch emissaries to
parley with the Parliamentary commanders at Aylesbury,
who answered them roughly, seized Dr. Pinke,
of New College, the deputy vice-chancellor, and sent
him as a prisoner to London. On the following day
Sir John Byron, with his few troopers, left Oxford to
join the king, accompanied by about a hundred scholars,
one of whom, Peter Turner, fell into the hands of the
enemy in a skirmish near Stow-in-the-Wold, and was
lodged in Northampton gaol. On September 12, a body
of Parliamentary troops entered the city from Aylesbury,
under Colonel Goodwin, who, with other officers, was
quartered at Merton College, while their horses were
turned out in Christchurch meadow. They were soon
followed by Lord Say, the new Parliamentary lord-lieutenant
of Oxfordshire. He proceeded to demolish
the fortifications already begun, and instituted a search<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
for plate and arms. In fact, however, no college plate
was then carried off, except that of Christchurch and
University College, which had been hidden away. The
other colleges, we are told, were spared, ‘upon condition
it should be forthcoming at the Parliament’s appointment,
and not in the least employed against them’—a
condition almost impossible of fulfilment in the event,
which actually occurred, of Oxford becoming the King’s
head-quarters. Upon the whole, Lord Say and his men
behaved with great forbearance during this short occupation,
which ended on September 27 or 28. The
gownsmen were disarmed, but no injury was done to
buildings or property, beyond some damage to the porch
of St. Mary’s Church and the combustion of ‘divers
Popish books and pictures.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oxford becomes
the
royal head-quarters</div>

<p>A month later (October 29) Charles I. marched
into Oxford by the North Gate, after the battle of Edgehill,
at the head of his army, and attended by
Prince Rupert, Prince Maurice, and his two
sons. Even the mayor and leading citizens
welcomed him, while the University received him with
open arms, expressed its devotion in Latin orations, and
showered degrees on the noblemen and courtiers in his
train. The king himself, with the most important personages
of his staff, except Rupert and Maurice, was
lodged in Christchurch; the officers were distributed
among other colleges; the soldiers were billeted about
the city. Thenceforward, Oxford became not only the
base of operations for the Royal army, but the chief
seat of the royal government. Twenty-seven pieces of
ordnance were driven into the grove of Magdalen College
and ranged there; the citizens were at first disarmed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
but a regiment of city volunteers was afterwards
formed, and reviewed together with a far more trustworthy
regiment of University volunteers. A plan of
fortification was prepared by Rallingson, a B.A. of
Queen’s College, and defensive works were constructed
all round Oxford under the directions of engineers. All
inmates of colleges, being of military age, were impressed
into labouring personally upon these works
for at least one entire day per week, bringing their
own tools with them; in default of which they were required
to pay twelve pence to the royal treasury. A
powder-mill was established at Oseney, and a mint at
New Inn Hall, whence the students had fled, under
suspicion of Roundhead leanings. Thither were removed
all the coining machinery and workmen from
the factory which had been established some time before
at Shrewsbury, and the New Inn Hall mint was conducted
under the direction of Thomas Bushell, formerly
the manager of the royal mines in Wales. New College
tower and cloisters were converted into an arsenal
for arms, procured by repeated searches, the grammar-school
for the choristers having been removed to a
chamber at the east end of the Hall. The Schools were
employed as granaries for the garrison; lectures and
exercises were almost wholly suspended; and in the
three years from 1643 to 1646 the annual number of
B.A. degrees conferred did not exceed fifty. Before
long, most of the less warlike and loyal fellows and
students retired into the country; those who remained
took up arms and kept guard on the walls; the colleges
more and more assumed the aspect of barracks; and
Oxford, no longer a seat of learning, was divided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
between the gaieties of a court and the turmoil of a
camp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aspect of
the University
during
the queen’s
residence</div>

<p>This transformation was completed in July 1643,
when Henrietta Maria joined the King at Oxford.
Charles I. rode out to meet the Queen, whose
passionate and sinister counsels were about to
cost him his throne and his life. She was
received with great ceremony at Christchurch, and conducted
by the King himself to Merton College by a
back way, made expressly through gardens belonging
to Christchurch and Corpus Christi College into Merton
Grove. There she was saluted with the usual Latin
oration, and took possession of the apartment still
known as ‘the Queen’s room,’ which she occupied, with
the adjoining drawing-room, until the following April.
Seldom in history, and never in the annals of the
University, have characters so diverse been grouped
together into so brilliant and picturesque a society
as that which thronged the good city of Oxford during
the Queen’s residence in the autumn and winter
of 1643—the last happy interlude of her ill-starred
life. Notwithstanding the paralysis of academical
studies, grave dons and gay young students were still
to be seen in the streets, but too often in no academical
garb and affecting the airs of cavaliers, as they mingled
with the ladies of the court in Christchurch walks and
Trinity College gardens, or with roystering troopers in
the guard-houses at Rewley, where they entertained
their ruder comrades with flashes of academic wit.
Most of the citizens, too, were glad to remain, secretly
cherishing, perhaps, the hope of a future retribution,
but not unwilling to levy high rents for the lodging of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
those nobles and military officers for whom there was
no room in the colleges. With these were blended in
strange variety other elements imported from the metropolis
or the country—lawyers who had come down to
attend the courts held by the Lord Keeper and one of
his judicial brethren; the faithful remnant of the Lords
and Commons, who sat in one of the Schools and the
Convocation-house respectively, while the University
Acts were performed once more in St. Mary’s Church;
loyal gentlemen driven out of their manor-houses by
the enemy; clergymen expelled from their parsonages;
foreigners seeking audiences of the perplexed and vacillating
King; needy poets, musicians, and players in
the service of the Court, who acted interludes or Shakespearian
pieces in the college halls. Services were still
performed in the chapels; sermons were preached from
the pulpit of St. Mary’s; degrees were conferred wholesale,
as rewards for loyal service, until they were so depreciated
that at last the King promised to recommend
no more candidates for them; the outward appearances
of academical routine were maintained with decorum;
the King dined and supped in public, moving freely
among his devoted adherents with the royal grace and
easy dignity which long seemed to have perished with
the Stuarts; the Queen held those receptions at Merton
College of which a tradition has survived to our own
prosaic days; newspapers were published for the first
time in Oxford, and all the resources of courtly literature
were employed to enliven a spectacle over which the
awful catastrophe of that historical tragedy, unforeseen
by the actors themselves, has shed a lurid glamour,
never equalled by the romance of fiction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The last two
years of the
civil war</div>

<p>During this memorable period, the records of the
University and colleges are extremely scanty. The
register of Christchurch, then little more than
a royal palace, presents almost a blank; that
of Merton contains few entries bearing on the great
events of which Oxford was the scene or the centre.
Early in January 1643, royal letters were issued to all
colleges and halls, desiring the loan of their plate, to be
melted down and coined for the King’s service, ‘we
promising you to see the same justly repayd unto you
after the rate of 5/ the ounce for white, and 5/6 for
guilt plate, as soon as God shall enable us.’ All the
colleges, except New Inn Hall, are stated to have complied,
and the aggregate weight of plate thus contributed
amounted to some 1,500 lbs., besides about
700 lbs. sent in by six country gentlemen. Nevertheless,
in the following June, another levy of 2,000<em>l.</em> was
made upon the University and City respectively, to
which the City, in an unwonted fit of loyalty, added
another 500<em>l.</em> At last, in October 1643, the Heads of
Houses agreed that 40<em>l.</em> should be raised weekly during
the next twenty weeks, by a levy on colleges and halls,
in lieu of all further contributions towards new fortifications.
In the same month articles were drawn up by
some of the leading residents against the Earl of Pembroke,
Chancellor of Oxford, whom they accused of betraying
the privileges and neglecting the interests of
the University, but whose real crime was complicity
with the Parliament, and whom the King caused to be
superseded by the Marquis of Hertford. During the
summer of this year the fortunes of war had, on the
whole, been in the King’s favour; but he had been compelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
to abandon his design of occupying London, and,
after the indecisive battle of Newbury, in which Falkland
was killed, had retreated to Oxford for the winter.
Thither he summoned his so-called Parliament in June
1644, and there, yielding to evil advice from his wife,
he rejected overtures which might have brought about
a peaceful settlement without further bloodshed. On
May 29, 1644, a Parliamentary force under the Earl
of Essex and Sir William Waller crossed the river at
Sandford Ferry, and passed through Cowley over Bullingdon
Green, on their way from Abingdon to Islip,
but nothing beyond a skirmish took place as they
defiled along the heights within sight of the city. The
object of this movement, as soon appeared, was to enclose
the King with his forces in Oxford; but Charles
now showed unexpected resource, and by a masterly
night-march eluded the enemy, and pursued Essex
westward, while Prince Rupert defeated Waller at Copredy
Bridge, where many Oxford scholars were engaged.
On June 9 a proclamation of the Privy Council
appeared, commanding all persons to lay in provisions
for three months, in anticipation of a siege, which, however,
did not take place in that year. On July 2 the
King’s northern army sustained a crushing defeat at
Marston Moor, and the King himself, though successful
against Essex, was almost cut off on his return to Oxford.
On Sunday, October 6, the city of Oxford, which
had been scourged by a plague in the previous year, the
natural result of overcrowding, was ravaged by a great
fire, attributed to the machinations of the Parliamentary
troops at Abingdon. The winter passed quietly at
Oxford, and, after the execution of Archbishop Laud in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
January 1645, negotiations between the King and Parliament
were again opened at Uxbridge, but in vain.
Soon afterwards the Parliamentary army was remodelled,
and placed under the command of Fairfax, who advanced
to besiege Oxford, while Charles, who had retired
to Chester, hesitated between relieving it and
giving battle to Cromwell. On May 22, Oxford was
partially invested by Fairfax, and besieged for a fortnight.
Fairfax established his own head-quarters at
Headington, Wolvercote was held by Major Browne,
Cromwell was posted at Wytham, and the roads between
that village and South Hincksey were secured by
the besiegers. On June 2, the governor made a successful
night sally towards Headington, and three days
later the siege was hastily abandoned, when Fairfax
moved northward to join Cromwell, and on June 14 the
Royalist cause was finally shipwrecked at the battle of
Naseby. The theatre of war was now shifted from the
neighbourhood of Oxford, and the last engagement in
the open field took place near Chester in the following
September. Oxford still held out for the King, who
again fell back upon it for the winter, accompanied by
Princes Rupert and Maurice, and gathered around him
a great part of the English nobility and gentry still
faithful to his fortunes. On December 28 we find him
ordering special forms of prayer to be used in college
chapels on Wednesdays and Fridays, ‘during these bad
times.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Siege of Oxford,
and
proposals of
Fairfax guaranteeing
University
privileges</div>

<p>In the spring of 1646, the Parliamentary army devoted
itself to besieging the strong places still occupied
by the King’s troops, and on May 1 Fairfax again appeared
before Oxford, which the King had left in disguise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
a few days earlier, with only two attendants. The besieging
force was distributed round the north side of the city
in the same way as before, and on May 11 it
was formally summoned to surrender. In the
letter of summons, addressed to Sir Thomas
Glemham, the governor, Fairfax used language
honourable to himself and to Oxford. ‘I very much
desire the preservation of that place, so famous for learning,
from ruin, which inevitably is like to fall upon it
unless you concur.’ More than one conference was held,
and some of the privy councillors in Oxford strove to
protract the negotiations until the King himself could
be consulted. In the end, Fairfax made conciliatory
proposals which the Royalist leaders decided to entertain,
‘submitting,’ as they said, ‘to the fate of the kingdom
rather than any way distrusting their own strength.’
By the final treaty, concluded on June 20, it was stipulated
that both the University and the City should
enjoy all their ancient privileges and immunities from
taxation. It was further stipulated that colleges should
‘enjoy their ancient form of government, subordinate
to the immediate authority and power of Parliament ... and
that all churches, chapels, &amp;c., shall be preserved
from defacing and spoil.’ It was, however, significantly
added that if any removals of Heads or other
members of the University should be made by Parliament,
the persons so removed should retain their emoluments
for six months after the surrender; and there
was an ominous proviso, ‘that this shall not extend to
any reformation there intended by the Parliament, nor
give them any liberty to intermeddle in the government.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Surrender of
Oxford, and
subsequent
condition
of the
University</div>

<p>Four days afterwards (June 24), the curtain fell on
this memorable episode in the history of the University.
The garrison of Oxford marched out 3,000
strong, with colours flying and drums beating,
in drenching rain, by Magdalen Bridge,
through St. Clement’s, over Shotover Hill,
between files of Roundhead infantry, lining the whole
route, but offering them no injury or affront. About
900 of them laid down their arms on arriving at Thame;
1,100 enlisted for service abroad. Hundreds of civilians
preceded or straggled after them; hundreds more,
chiefly nobles and gentlemen, accompanied Prince
Rupert and Prince Maurice two days later, besides a
large body which proceeded northward and westward,
through St. Giles’s, with a convoy. Nevertheless, some
two thousand remained behind, to whom passes were
afterwards given by Fairfax. These consisted mainly
of ‘gentlemen and their servants, scholars, citizens, and
inhabitants, not properly of the garrison in pay,’ who
had been specially permitted by the articles of surrender
to choose their own time for departure. The military
stores had contained no less than six months’ provision,
and seventy barrels of powder were found in the magazine.
Indeed, the writer of an official report, addressed
to Speaker Lenthall, congratulates the Parliament on
the bloodless capture of the great Royalist stronghold,
especially as the surrounding fields were soon afterwards
flooded, and siege operations would have been greatly
impeded. Order now reigned again at Oxford, but
the University and colleges were almost emptied of
students, and utterly impoverished; notwithstanding
which, some of them contributed out of their penury to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
relieve the poor of the city, and All Souls’ passed a self-denying
ordinance ‘that there shall be only one meal a
day between this and next Christmas, and so longer, if
we shall see occasion.’ Anthony Wood’s brief description
of the state of the University after the siege had
often been quoted, but deserves a place in every history
of the University, since it is the testimony of an eye-witness:
‘The colleges were much out of repair by the
negligence of soldiers, courtiers, and others who lay in
them; a few chambers which were the meanest (in
some colleges none at all) being reserved for the use of
the scholars. Their treasure and plate was all gone,
the books of some libraries embezzled, and the number
of scholars few, and mostly indigent. The halls (wherein,
as in some colleges, ale and beer were sold by the
penny in their respective butteries) were very ruinous.
Further, also, having few or none in them except their
respective Principals and families, the chambers in them
were, to prevent ruin and injuries of weather, rented
out to laicks. In a word, there was scarce the face of
an University left, all things being out of order and
disturbed.’ This description is confirmed by college
records, still extant, one of which attests the desolation
of Merton, so long occupied by the Queen’s retainers.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Measures
preparatory
to the
Visitation</div>

<p class="no-indent">The Parliament, then dominated by Presbyterians, lost
no time in preparing the University for the coming
‘reformation,’ by sending down seven Presbyterian
divines with power to preach in any
Oxford church. These preachers were all
University men, and included Reynolds, Cheynell,
Henry Wilkinson, and Corbet—four scholars of some
repute, and less obnoxious than such army chaplains as
Hugh Peters, who had already obtruded themselves into
the Oxford pulpits. Wood ridicules the effort to convert
the academical mind through Presbyterian discourses;
but there is evidence that it was not without
its effect, though it provoked opposition from the rising
sect of the Independents, already established in Oxford,
and good Churchmen were edified by a fierce disputation
between Cheynell and one Erbury, an Independent
army chaplain, formerly of Brasenose College, the
favourite of the fanatical soldiery. At the same time a
Parliamentary order was issued inhibiting elections to
University or college offices, and the making or renewal
of leases ‘until the pleasure of Parliament be
made known therein.’ Such interventions were of
course warmly resented by academical Royalists, especially
as the King was still nominally in possession of his
throne, and could only be justified on the assumption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
that sovereign authority now resided in the Parliament
alone. On this assumption, however, they were in
accordance with the policy of the four last Tudors, who
had treated the University as a national institution, to
be moulded into conformity with each successive modification
of the National Church. Philip, Earl of Pembroke,
who had been deposed in 1643 to make room for
the Marquis of Hertford, now resumed his office, but
does not appear to have exercised any moderating control
over the counsels either of the Parliament or of
the University. Meanwhile, the conflict between rival
preachers and the suspension of academical independence
naturally produced a state of anarchy in academical
society, whose leading spirits were silently organising
themselves against the coming Visitation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appointment
of the
Visitors and
the Standing
Committee
of Parliament</div>

<p>The delay of the Parliament in commencing this Visitation
may well have been due to more urgent claims on
their energy. On January 30, 1647, the King
had been given up at Newcastle to the Parliamentary
commissioners, and other events
of the greatest moment followed each other in
quick succession. Presbyterianism was ostensibly established
by the Westminster Assembly, but generally
accepted by a small part only of the kingdom, and
undermined by the hostility of the Independents. The
so-called ‘Four Ordinances’ passed by Parliament, and
designed to weaken the power of the army, had been
met by a protest from a great meeting of officers held
at Saffron Walden. This brought about an acute
conflict between these rival powers, and ‘the Lords and
Commons assembled in Parliament’ were meditating
their unsuccessful attempt to disband the army at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
very time when they passed an ordinance, on May 1, 1647,
‘for the Visitation and Reformation of the University
of Oxford and the several Colleges and Halls therein.’
The object of the Visitation was expressly defined to be
‘the due correction of offences, abuses, and disorders,
especially of late times committed there.’ The Visitors
were twenty-four in number, fourteen laymen and ten
clergymen, with Sir Nathaniel Brent, Warden of Merton
College, as the chairman; but the laymen gradually ceased
to attend, and the work mainly fell into the hands of the
clerical Visitors. Among the lay Visitors were several
lawyers, including Brent himself and Prynne; among
the clerical visitors were three fellows of Merton, and
the Principal of Magdalen Hall, which, like Merton,
was strongly tinged with Presbyterian opinions. The
Visitors were instructed to inquire by oath concerning
those who neglected to take the ‘Solemn League and
Covenant’ or the ‘Negative Oath,’ those who opposed
the execution of the orders of Parliament concerning
the discipline and the Directory, those who contravened
‘any point of doctrine the ignorance whereof doth exclude
from the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper,’ and
those who had borne arms against the Parliament. By
the same ordinance a Standing Committee of Lords and
Commons was appointed to receive reports and hear
appeals from the Visitors; but it soon outstepped these
functions, and sometimes took upon itself the right of
legislating directly for the University.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early proceedings
of
the Visitors,
and suppression
of resistance
from the
University</div>

<p>The proceedings of the Visitors were opened by a
citation issued upon May 15, 1647, summoning the
University to appear before them on June 4, but an
absurd informality led to an adjournment, which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
events that followed the seizure of the King at Holmby
House prolonged for three months. During the interval,
a delegacy appointed by the University to
conduct its defence had drawn up a very
forcible statement of ‘Reasons’ for not submitting
to the new tests about to be imposed.
The moderation and ability of this statement
did much to consolidate the opposition to the Visitation,
furnished a repertory of materials for the
answers afterwards made by individual colleges, and
earned the special thanks of the Parliament held at
Oxford in 1665. The internal struggles between the
Presbyterians and the Independents favoured the University,
but the Committee of Lords and Commons intervened
and armed the Visitors with fresh powers,
including that of compelling the production of documents,
imprisoning the contumacious, and pronouncing
definitive sentences of expulsion. This arbitrary commission,
endorsed by the Chancellor of the University,
was conferred upon the Visitors in the name of the king,
himself a prisoner in the hands of the Parliament. On
September 29, 1647, their operations actually commenced
with prayers and preaching ‘for three hours
together,’ after which all the Heads of Houses were cited
to appear, Dean Fell of Christchurch being specially
cited as vice-chancellor, and a number of resident
fellows were appointed to act as assistants to the Visitors,
‘and to enquire into the behaviour of all Governours,
Professors, Officers, and Members.’ A large majority
of the University and college authorities offered a resolute
though passive resistance, and when the vice-chancellor,
as the avowed leader of the malcontents, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
seized and imprisoned, the Visitors found their legal
action more paralysed than ever for want of any constitutional
authority through which their orders could be
carried out. The London Committee, however, again came
to their rescue, and on November 11, 1647, six Heads of
colleges, with three canons of Christchurch, and the two
proctors, were forced to appear before this Committee.
Selden, Whitelocke, and others stood their friends, but
the adverse majority prevailed, and sentence of deprivation
was pronounced upon most of them. Still the Visitors’
orders were disregarded, and ‘not a man stirred from
his place or removed.’ At last, on February 18, 1648,
Reynolds was appointed vice-chancellor by the Earl of
Pembroke, and the proctors superseded in favour of men
who could be trusted—Crosse of Lincoln and Button of
Merton; while the Chancellor himself was deputed, on
March 8, to instal the new functionaries in office, and
to bring the University into subjection. On March 30
a further order of deprivation was published, embracing
the removal of Sheldon from the wardenship of All
Souls’, and Hammond from his canonry of Christchurch.
About the same time the Visitors were empowered to
use the military force at their disposal, and on April 11
the Chancellor himself arrived to enforce obedience. He
found the University in a state of almost open mutiny
against the Parliament and the Visitors. In spite of
fresh orders and the appearance of a body of troops sent
down by Fairfax, the Heads of Houses sentenced to expulsion
refused to quit their colleges, Mrs. Fell retained
possession of the deanery in her husband’s absence,
and when the members of Convocation were solemnly
cited to meet the Visitors a mere handful responded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
Great pains had been taken to mar the dignity of the
Chancellor’s reception, and loyal pamphleteers lavished
their bitterest jests on the absence of academical ceremony,
the presence of soldiers, and the substitution of an
English for a Latin address of welcome. But all serious
resistance was now vain. During a stay of three days
Pembroke was lodged at Merton, where the Visitors
usually held their sittings in the Warden’s house, and
had already abstracted the University register from the
rooms of French, the registrar, who happened to be a
fellow of the college. Reynolds was installed as vice-chancellor;
ten Heads of colleges were actually ejected,
most of the professors and canons of Christchurch shared
the same fate; two vacant headships were immediately
filled up, and worthy successors were appointed to most
of the offices vacated by expulsion; new Masters of Arts
were created, some imported from Cambridge, and the
Visitors proceeded to purge each college with a view to
its re-organisation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visitation of
colleges.
Submissions
and expulsions</div>

<p>The details of these collegiate Visitations are beyond
the scope of general University history, but they were
all conducted on the same principle. Every
member of the college, from the Head to the
humblest servant, was asked whether he would
submit. No evasions were allowed, and the ‘non-submitters’
were at once turned out. At a later period
(November 1648) the London Committee insisted on
the Visitors tendering also the Negative Oath, involving
an abjuration of all connection with the King, his
council, or his officers, and the refusal of this new test
led to some further expulsions. After the lapse of a
year, the London Committee went one step further, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
required subscription to ‘the Engagement,’ pledging
the signatories to a government without a King or
House of Lords. Reynolds, Pocock, and Mills, who
had taken all the former tests, resigned their offices
rather than submit to this, but it does not seem to have
been strictly or universally applied. No exact list of
the cases in which the Visitors exercised their jurisdiction
can now be made out, but the evidence preserved
in the ‘Visitors’ Register,’ which has come down to us,
leads to the conclusion that the numbers of the submissions
and expulsions were nearly equal, amounting
in each case to 400 or 500, and spread over several
years. So obstinate was the resistance of some colleges
that it was at last thought necessary to proclaim that
any expelled members remaining in Oxford should incur
the penalty of death. But the functions of the Visitors
were by no means purely inquisitorial and judicial.
They also superintended, and often personally directed,
the whole internal management of colleges, regulating
leases, dictating admissions to scholarships and fellowships,
making arrangements for examinations, deciding
on the rate of allowances, suggesting if not prescribing
the alteration of statutes, and overriding corporate
rights of self-government with a despotic air which Laud
might have envied.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reception of
Fairfax and
Cromwell</div>

<p>While they were thus engaged, Fairfax and Cromwell
visited Oxford together in state on May 17, 1649.
They were lodged and entertained at All Souls’,
in the absence of the new Warden, now on
duty in Parliament, by Zanchy, the sub-warden, and
one of the proctors, who happened to be a colonel in
the Parliamentary army. Both the generals received a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
D.C.L. degree, and Cromwell, addressing the University
authorities on behalf of himself and Fairfax, professed
his respect for the interests of learning, and assured
them of his desire to promote these interests for the
sake of the commonwealth. They dined at Magdalen,
played bowls on the college green, had supper in the
Bodleian Library, and attended University sermons at
St. Mary’s. There is no reason to doubt the sincerity
of the assurances given by Cromwell, who became Chancellor
on the death of Pembroke, in January 1650. In
this capacity, he not only presented the University with
a collection of manuscripts, but resisted the reduction of
academical endowments proposed by the Barebones Parliament,
and supported by Milton; while Fairfax, himself
a man of scholarlike tastes, had already proved his regard
for the University when the city was in his power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second
Board of
Visitors</div>

<p>The first stage of the Visitation terminated in April
1652, when the London Committee was dissolved, and
the Visitors ceased to act. Their work had
been constantly interrupted by differences with
the London Committee, whom they recognised as their
official superiors, but who had of course little acquaintance
with University affairs. These bodies were equally
resolved to Presbyterianise the University, to make its
education more emphatically religious, to strengthen
moral discipline, and to enforce such rules as those
against excess in dress, and even that which enjoined
the colloquial use of Latin. They differed chiefly in
their mode of action, the Visitors desiring to adopt a
more conciliatory attitude, and to show more respect for
academical independence than the London Committee
was prepared to sanction. Several changes had taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
place among the former, and the retirement of Reynolds
had weakened the moderate party on a board which, however,
remained distinctively Presbyterian. During the
fourteen months between April 1652 and June 1653
the history of the University, like the Visitors’ Register,
presents almost a blank. On September 9, 1652,
Owen, who had succeeded Reynolds as Dean of Christchurch,
was nominated vice-chancellor by Cromwell.
On October 16 he was placed at the head of a commission
to execute all the Chancellor’s official powers.
With him were associated Goddard, the Warden of
Merton; Wilkins, the Warden of Wadham; Goodwin, the
President of Magdalen; and Peter French, prebendary
of Christchurch; and the government of the University
seems to have been practically transferred from the
Visitors into their hands. Of these men, Goddard had
been head physician to Cromwell’s army in Ireland, and
afterwards in Scotland; Owen and Goodwin had been
his chaplains, and thoroughly enjoyed his confidence;
Wilkins was one of the most eminent scientific authorities
of his time; French was Cromwell’s brother-in-law
and had been on the Board of Visitors. All of these,
except Wilkins, were appointed, with five others, to
serve on a new and temporary Board of Visitors, for
the creation of which the University itself had petitioned,
in order to carry on the new academical settlement,
with the expression of a hope that they might be
fewer in number than before, and all resident. The
proceedings of this Board, in which the Independents
were more strongly represented, deserve but little
notice. The process of weeding out the University and
colleges having been completed, and strict rules laid down,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
little remained except to interpret these rules, to organise
the new system, and to guard against the revival
of abuses. The Visitors, however, agreed to meet every
Monday and Tuesday, and succeeded in doing much
useful work. In September 1654, the Board was reconstituted
by Cromwell, who had been solemnly congratulated
by the University on his assumption of the
Protectorate in the previous December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Third Board
of Visitors,
and conclusion
of the
Visitation</div>

<p>As Owen had been the ruling spirit on the second
Board of Visitors, so this last was mainly dominated by
the influence of Goodwin, and contained several
additional members, some Presbyterians. It
lasted no less than four years, but the records
of its proceedings are but scanty, and chiefly relate to
corrections of abuses, such as corrupt resignations of
fellowships and irregular elections. In short, the Parliamentary
Visitors, having placed the government of
the University and colleges in hands which they regarded
as trustworthy, were mainly occupied in discharging
the functions which properly belonged to the
Chancellor and the ordinary Visitors of the several
colleges. In an appeal from Jesus College, they deliberately
set aside the jurisdiction of the Earl of Pembroke
as hereditary Visitor of that society. On the other
hand, after Cromwell’s resignation of the chancellorship
on July 3, 1657, they went so far as to lay before him
their decision on an important case at All Souls’, and
received from him an assurance ‘of all due encouragement
and countenance from his Highnesse and the
Councell.’ Even while they were claiming a paramount
authority, the University was insensibly recovering its
independence. As vice-chancellor and Dean of Christchurch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
Owen was still a great power in the University,
and supported a body of Delegates who proposed a sort
of provisional constitution for the University under
which independent representatives of Convocation would
have been associated with the Visitors. In another
instance, Owen sought to override a vote of Convocation
against reforms which he proposed by the direct action
of the Visitors and even of the Protector’s Council, but
was foiled in the first attempt, and dissuaded from
making the second. In fact, the University had begun
to legislate again for itself, and was becoming somewhat
impatient of being nursed and schooled by a meddlesome
select committee of its own members. As Convocation
alleged, ‘Visitors residing upon the place do rather
nourish and ferment than appease differences,’ and
there was a natural resentment against Heads of colleges
acting as judges on their own causes. Having done its
real work, the Visitation was perishing of inanition.
After Richard Cromwell had been elected Chancellor in
July 1657, he appointed Dr. Conant, Rector of Exeter,
vice-chancellor, and from this moment Conant, whose
importance had long been growing, became the real
governor of the University. With a firmness and zeal
for reform fully equal to Owen’s, he combined a more
conciliatory and statesmanlike character, and while he
resisted, as the champion of academical privileges, Cromwell’s
scheme for a new University at Durham, he stoutly
upheld the autonomy of colleges against the project for
superseding all episcopal Visitors. Nevertheless, for six
months after his nomination to the vice-chancellorship the
Parliamentary Visitors continued to meet, and to make
occasional orders, the last of which is dated April 8,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
1658, when their register breaks off abruptly. It is not
known how their commission was terminated, or whether
it was terminated at all. By this time, however, it
was beginning to be manifest that, after all, the old
order in Church and State was regretted by a majority
of the people, and that England was almost tired of Puritan
despotism. Parliament itself had virtually established
an amended monarchy with a new House of
Lords, and the army alone had prevented Cromwell from
assuming the title of King. No one was better aware
than he of the reaction in popular sentiment, calling for
a revival of the institutions so hastily demolished, and
his prescient mind foreboded, if it did not actually
foresee, the coming restoration of the Stuarts. In this
last year of his life there was no force in the central
government to push on further interference with Oxford.
Moreover the University was now in good order, and
possessed the confidence of the nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">State of the
University
on the recovery
of its
independence</div>

<p>It is clear, indeed, from scattered notices of passing
events, that its inner life had been less disturbed by the
presence of the Visitors than we might infer
from the space which they naturally fill in
University history, and that since the close of
the Civil War Oxford studies and habits had
been gradually resuming their ordinary course. It is
some proof of this that even during the Puritan interregnum
no order was issued to put down the disorderly
and indecorous buffoonery of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terræ Filii</i>, those
self-constituted and privileged satirists whose sallies
upon University dignitaries continued to scandalise
graver censors of academical morals for several generations.
When John Evelyn visited Oxford in 1654,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
and witnessed the celebration of the Act in St. Mary’s
Church, he found ‘the ancient ceremonies and institutions
as yet not wholly abolished,’ enjoyed the usual
round of festivities, and admired the mechanical inventions
contrived by Dr. Wilkins with the aid of young
Christopher Wren. In the following year a coffee-house
was opened opposite All Souls’ College, and largely frequented
by Royalists and others ‘who esteemed themselves
either <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">virtuosi</i> or wits,’ and in many a private house
the services of the Church were regularly performed by
clergymen in surplices, to congregations of gownsmen,
with the full knowledge, if not the actual connivance, of
Cromwell and the Visitors. The academical population
was already larger than it had been in the reign of
James I., and the University contained quite as many
scholars and divines of established reputation. Throughout
all the disorders and confusion incident to revolutionary
times, it had never ceased to be respected as a home of
religion and learning, and Clarendon himself bears unconscious
witness to the character of the Visitation in
the well-known passage which concludes his strictures
upon it. For, after denouncing it as a reign of barbarism,
he proceeds to say that, in spite of all, the University
‘yielded a harvest of extraordinary good and sound
knowledge in all parts of learning, and many who were
wickedly introduced applied themselves to the study of
good learning and the practice of virtue, and had inclination
to that duty and obedience they had never been
taught, so that when it pleased God to bring King Charles
the Second back to his throne, he found that University
abounding in excellent learning, and devoted to duty
and obedience little inferior to what it was before its
desolation.’</p>

<span class="fs80">THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE RESTORATION AND THE
REVOLUTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Restoration
and new
Visitation of
the University</div>

<p class="no-indent">On Monday, February 13, 1660, news was brought to
Oxford that a ‘free Parliament,’ or Convention, was about
to be assembled, and was hailed with great
rejoicings as a sure presage of the coming
Restoration. On May 29 Charles II. entered
London, and in June a new set of Visitors appeared
at Oxford to undo the work of their predecessors under
the Commonwealth. This Visitation was issued at the
instance, if not by the direct authority, of the Marquis
of Hertford, who succeeded Richard Cromwell on his
resignation in May on the King’s return, and who himself,
dying in the following October, was succeeded
by Clarendon. Wood draws a graphic picture of the
various emotions pourtrayed in the countenances of the
defeated and victorious parties at Oxford, the one plucking
their hats over their eyes and foreseeing speedy
retribution, the others with cheerful looks, and reinstating
‘all tokens of monarchy that were lately defaced
or obscured in the University.’ Happily, the personal
constitution of the commission was by no means exclusive,
since at least eight of its members had submitted
to the last Visitation, and held offices during the
‘usurpation,’ as it was now to be called. Their instructions,
too, were mainly directed to a restitution of
expelled Royalists, of whom the number had greatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
dwindled in the interval, many having died or ‘changed
their religion,’ while others, being married, were no
longer eligible for college fellowships. It is said that
not above one-sixth remained to be restored, but among
these were several persons of considerable note. Sheldon
had already regained the wardenship of All Souls’;
Walker recovered the mastership of University; Oliver
again became President of Magdalen; Yate, Principal
of Brasenose; Newlin, President of Corpus; Potter,
President of Trinity; Baylis, President of St. John’s;
Mansell, Principal of Jesus; and Wightwick, Master of
Pembroke. Reynolds was appointed in quick succession
Dean of Christchurch and Warden of Merton, whence
he was promoted to the see of Norwich in the following
year. A large proportion of the fellows elected during
the previous Visitation were allowed to keep their places,
for which there were no rival claimants; others, though
statutably elected, were turned out, but in some cases
they were consoled with chaplaincies or other subordinate
posts. Two or three months sufficed to complete
these personal changes, but a royal letter re-established
all the statutes and regulations in force before the ‘usurpation,’
including the oaths introduced under James I.,
and this letter, coupled with the Act of Uniformity
passed in 1662, must have rendered the positions of
many Puritans at Oxford practically untenable. By a
clause in that Act, it was for the first time required that
every person elected to a college fellowship should
make a declaration of conformity to the liturgy of the
Church of England in the presence of the vice-chancellor.
Such a provision had a sensible effect in making Oxford
once more a seminary of the clergy and country gentry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
but there was no violent break in the continuity of its
corporate life. For some little time after the Restoration,
the University was in an unsettled state, and the
students, released from the bondage of Puritan discipline,
betrayed some pardonable excitement; but good order
revived under a succession of prudent vice-chancellors,
and Oxford, so long the battle-ground of rival parties in
the State, enjoyed comparative repose under Charles II.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extension of
University
buildings.
Sheldonian
Theatre</div>

<p>Several improvements in the external features of the
city and University may be dated from this reign. Not
the least was the erection of the famous
Sheldonian Theatre for the performance of the
annual Acts, now known as ‘Commemorations,’
and other academical solemnities. This building
was founded by Gilbert Sheldon, who, having resumed
the wardenship of All Souls’ in 1660, and become
Archbishop of Canterbury in 1663, was elected Chancellor
in succession to Clarendon in 1667. In common
with many Anglicans of the Laudian school, Sheldon
had long objected to the profanation of St. Mary’s Church
involved in the use of it as a kind of academical town-hall
for scholastic exercises and secular displays. Perhaps
the contempt of the Puritans for sacred edifices
had quickened the zeal of Royalists for their dedication
to strictly religious purposes; at all events, the archbishop
offered 1,000<em>l.</em> towards the construction of
a suitable theatre, and, meeting with little support
from others, ultimately took upon himself the whole
cost, amounting to 25,000<em>l.</em> The mode in which the
site was procured illustrates the change which was
already passing over mediæval Oxford, now in process
of conversion from a fortified into an open town.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
Though a great part of the walls was preserved, and
the city gates survived for another century, the ditch
was being filled up and new streets constructed along
the course of it. Several houses adjoining the old
ramparts were purchased on the north side of the
Divinity School; Christopher Wren was engaged as the
architect, and Streeter as the painter of the pictures
which adorn the ceiling; and the building, having been
commenced in 1664, was completed in 1669—the year
in which the Divinity School was restored according to
Wren’s designs. John Evelyn received a degree at the
first academical festival held in it, and was as much
impressed by the grandeur of the spectacle and the
learning of the discourses as he was shocked by the
vulgar ribaldry of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terræ Filius</i>. It is worthy of
notice that in the address delivered on this occasion by
Dr. South, as Public Orator, were ‘some malicious and
indecent reflections on the Royal Society, as underminers
of the University.’ That society, in fact, passed through
much of its infancy, if it did not take its birth, at
Oxford. Among its earliest and most influential members
were Dr. Wilkins, the Warden of Wadham, Dr. Goddard,
the Warden of Merton, and Dr. Wallis, a Cambridge man,
who afterwards became Savilian professor of geometry
in Oxford. These and others were in the habit of meeting
for scientific discussions at Goddard’s lodgings, or
Gresham College, in London, before the end of the Civil
War, but about 1649 all three of them were settled in
Oxford, where they found congenial associates in such
men as William Petty, Robert Boyle, and Wren, and
resumed their meetings in Petty’s or Wilkins’ lodgings,
while the rest continued to meet in London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Growth of
æsthetic
tastes and
social refinement</div>

<p>Other facts attest the variety of intellectual life and
interests at Oxford during the same period. Evelyn
speaks of an organ as placed in the upper
gallery of the theatre, and of ‘excellent music,
both vocal and instrumental,’ as part of the
programme at the opening of the Sheldonian Theatre.
The earliest order for the apportionment of seats assigns
that very gallery ‘for the performance of music,’ while
it allots places to ladies, strangers, and ‘Cambridge
scholars.’ Thenceforth music played a considerable
part among academical recreations, and a taste for the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles-lettres</i> and the fine arts was rapidly developed.
In 1677, the Arundel marbles were presented to the
University by the Earl of Arundel, mainly owing to
the assiduous exertions of John Evelyn; on May 24,
1683, the Ashmolean Museum was opened, and in the
next month Convocation accepted Elias Ashmole’s gift
of all his ‘rarities,’ consisting of valuable collections in
natural history and antiquities. A certain air of literary
dilettantism was characteristic of the same age at the
University as well as in the metropolis. Under a statute
passed in 1662, bachelors of Arts were required, before
inception, to recite from memory two Latin declamations
of their own composition, and from this period may be
dated the gradual triumph of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Literæ Humaniores</i> over
scholastic disputations in the examination-system of
Oxford. Versification in Latin now became a favourite
pastime of Oxford scholars, and many poems of doubtful
Latinity on the politics or philosophy of the day were
composed there during the latter half of the seventeenth
century. In the meanwhile, modern notions
of comfort were beginning to modify the old austerity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
of college life. The earliest of Oxford common-rooms
was instituted at Merton College in 1661, and sixteen
years later Anthony Wood mentions ‘common chambers’
together with alehouses (of which there were said to be
above 370), and the newly established ‘coffea-houses,’
as contributing to the decay of ‘solid and serious learning.’
College gardens, too, received far more attention
than before, and we may still trace on Loggan’s maps
and plans the geometrical designs upon which these
little plots were ingeniously laid out by the Caroline
landscape-gardeners, though Magdalen ‘water walks’
retained their native wildness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First
visit of
Charles II.</div>

<p>Charles II. twice visited Oxford, where his presence
and example could scarcely have been conducive to
virtue or decorum among the students. His
reign is marked by frequent interference with
the freedom of college elections, in the form of attempts
to use fellowships as rewards for his favourites or the
relations of old cavaliers, though in more than one instance
he gracefully retracted his mandate. When he
arrived at Oxford from Salisbury, in September 1665, the
plague was at its height in London. There he remained
until the following February, lodging, as usual, at
Christchurch, while the Queen was accommodated at
Merton, residing in the very rooms in which her mother-in-law,
Henrietta Maria, held her Court during the Civil
War. Miss Stuart, afterwards Duchess of Richmond,
occupied a fellow’s rooms in the same college, and
another set was assigned to Barbara Villiers, Lady Castlemaine,
and afterwards Duchess of Cleveland. In these
rooms, on December 28, 1665, was born her son, George
Villiers, afterwards Earl of Northumberland and Duke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
of Grafton. It is stated in the college register that
bachelor fellows and scholars were turned out of their
chambers to make room for the Court, and that as there
were more ladies than students in the chapel, ‘ordinary
prayers’ were used in the service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second
visit of
Charles II.
Parliament
assembled
and dissolved
at
Oxford</div>

<p>Sixteen years had elapsed before Charles II. again
visited Oxford, in the spring of 1681, to open the last
Parliament ever held in the city, supposing
that Whig members would there be subjected
to loyalist influences, and more amenable to
his own dictation. The supposed discovery of
the ‘Popish Plot’ in 1678 had provoked a
fresh outburst of Protestant enthusiasm and bigotry.
An Act had been passed disabling all Papists, except
the Duke of York, from sitting in either House of
Parliament, and was quickly followed by a Bill to exclude
the Duke of York from the succession. To arrest
the progress of this Bill, two Parliaments had been dissolved
by the King, and that summoned to meet at
Oxford lasted but a week. The King journeyed thither
surrounded by his guards of horse and foot, while the
Exclusionist leaders were escorted by hosts of friends
and armed retainers. On this occasion, the schools of
geometry, astronomy, and Greek were fitted up for the
House of Lords, the Convocation House being adapted
to receive the Commons. The Commons again brought
in the Exclusion Bill. The King met it with a strange
proposal that, after his own death, the government
should be carried on in James’s name by the Prince of
Orange as Regent. The Commons persisted with the
Bill, whereupon the Parliament was suddenly dissolved
by the King, who had quietly put the crown and robes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
of state into a sedan chair, got into it himself, and surprised
both Houses by his sudden appearance to close
the session. During this short crisis, anti-Papist sentiments
found expression among the gownsmen, but we
may safely assume that a majority of graduates were
secretly in favour of the King against the Exclusionists.
Anthony Wood, remarking on the decline of students in
1682, attributes it to three causes. The first is the
constant expectation of another Parliament to be held at
Oxford, and the fear of being turned out to make room
for members. The second is that ‘all those that we
call Whigs’ (a name just invented) ‘and side with the
Parliament, will not send their sons for fear of their
being Tories.’ The last is that the University, like the
Episcopal bench, labours under the suspicion of a leaning
towards Popery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doctrine of
passive resistance

the University.
Expulsion
of
Locke</div>

<p>In the following year, the University was afforded a
good opportunity for demonstrating its sympathy with
the Duke of York by the disclosure of the
so-called ‘Rye House Plot.’ Accordingly, on
July 21, 1683, Convocation passed a decree
again condemning the doctrine that resistance
to a king is lawful, which doctrine it formulated
in six propositions expressly stated to have been culled
from the works of Milton, Baxter, and Goodwin. By
the same decree, however, the University recorded an
equally solemn anathema against other heresies mostly
founded on the despotic principles of Hobbes’ ‘Leviathan,’
thereby anticipating the verdict of the country in
1688. Within three months of his death, Charles II.,
acting on these principles, was betrayed into a strange
piece of intolerance, more worthy of his successor, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
which he was abetted by the Chapter of Christchurch, and
of which the illustrious John Locke was the victim. On
November 5, 1684, a letter was addressed by Sunderland
to Dr. John Fell, Dean of Christchurch and Bishop of
Oxford, directing him to ‘have Locke removed from
being a student.’ Fell replied that Locke had been
carefully watched for years, but had never been heard to
utter a disloyal word against the government, notwithstanding
which he basely offered to procure his removal
on receipt of an order from the King, and actually did so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conduct of
the University
on the
outbreak of
Monmouth’s
rebellion.
James II.’s
treatment of
Magdalen
College</div>

<p>In the first year of James II.’s reign, the University
of Oxford was once more stirred by martial ardour, when
the Duke of Monmouth landed in Dorsetshire.
Volunteers from the colleges mustered in great
force to oppose him; a troop of horse and a
regiment of foot were enrolled under the Earl
of Abingdon, and the victory of Sedgemoor
was celebrated with academical bonfires, in
which, for once, the City took part. A week later, upon
a false alarm, the volunteers were again called out, but
soon disbanded. With that strange ignorance of his
countrymen which ultimately proved his ruin, James
interpreted these signs of loyalty as pledges of abject
devotion to his person, and proceeded to strain the well-tried
fidelity of the University by gross outrages on its
privileges. The grand secret of his fatuous statecraft
was the use of the dispensing power, as its end was the
supremacy of the Crown and the restoration of the
ancient faith. Having obtained an opinion from the
judges favourable to this dispensing power, he had bestowed
commissions in the army and Church preferments
on several professed Romanists. Fell was succeeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
as Dean by Massey, an avowed Papist, nominated
by James, and soon afterwards both the Universities
were attacked by the new Court of High Commission.
Cambridge boldly refused to obey a royal mandate for
the admission of a Benedictine to a degree without
taking the usual oath. A severer ordeal was prepared
for Oxford. With such instruments as Obadiah Walker,
the Master of University, the King seriously meditated
the conversion of the University, and dispensations were
granted for establishing Romanistic services in colleges.
By the Declaration of Indulgence, issued in 1687, James
assumed to make Roman Catholics admissible to corporations;
and the colleges appeared to offer a favourable
trial ground for the experiment. All Souls’ had just
escaped a royal mandate for the election of a Roman
Catholic to its wardenship by electing an extreme Tory
of doubtful character, who had friends at Court. The
presidentship of Magdalen College was now vacant,
and Farmer, a Papist of notoriously bad character, was
recommended for it by royal letters. The fellows refused
to comply, justifying their refusal on the ground that
James’s nominee was not only unfit for the office but
was also disqualified by their statutes. Accordingly,
after vainly petitioning the King to withdraw his command,
they elected Hough, one of their own body, to
whom no exception could be taken. The election was
confirmed by the Visitor, but annulled by the new Court
of High Commission, under the presidency of Jefferies,
who treated a deputation from the college with brutal
insolence. The King then issued another order, commanding
the college to elect Parker, bishop of Oxford,
an obsequious tool of his own policy. He even came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
Oxford in person, on September 4, 1687, in order to enforce
obedience, and did not scruple to intimidate the fellows
with rude threats of his royal displeasure in case they
should prove contumacious. The conduct of Magdalen
on this occasion was eminently constitutional, and had
no slight influence in determining the attitude of the
nation. The fellows maintained their rights firmly but
respectfully, and unanimously declined submission to
any arbitrary authority. Thereupon a commission was
appointed with full powers to dispossess all recusants by
military force, and the new President and twenty-five
fellows were actually ejected and declared incapable of
Church preferment. Parker died within a twelvemonth,
but James substituted one Gifford, a Papist of the Sorbonne,
and was proceeding to repeople the college with
Roman Catholics when the acquittal of the Seven
Bishops and the invitation to William of Orange suddenly
opened his eyes to his real position. During the
month of October 1688 he made desperate efforts to
save himself from ruin, restoring many officers deprived
of their commissions, dissolving the Ecclesiastical Commission,
and removing Sunderland and Petre from his
council. In this death-bed fit of repentance he addressed
letters to the bishop of Winchester, as Visitor
of Magdalen, reinstating the ejected fellows, who, however,
had scarcely returned before James had abdicated,
and William and Mary had been proclaimed.</p>

<span class="fs80">UNIVERSITY POLITICS BETWEEN THE REVOLUTION AND
THE ACCESSION OF GEORGE III.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude of
the University
towards
the Revolution.
Visit
of William
III.</div>

<p class="no-indent">The Revolution of 1688-9 seems to have been quietly
accepted at Oxford as an irrevocable fact rather than
welcomed as the consecration of civil and religious
liberty. For a while, indeed, the outrageous
invasion of academical privileges by
James II. produced its natural effect, and
deputies from the University were despatched to salute
William III. at Crewkerne, after his landing in Torbay.
William actually came as far as Abingdon, but, there
receiving news of James’s flight, sent to excuse himself,
and hurried on towards London. Burnet tells us that,
at the same time, and at his request, the ‘Association,’
or pledge to support him in restoring order and liberty,
was signed by almost all the Heads of colleges and the
chief men of the University. But he adds that some
of the signatories, ‘being disappointed in the preferments
they aspired to, became afterwards King William’s
most implacable enemies.’ At all events, reactionary
tendencies gradually manifested themselves, and it is
said that Locke, who had little cause for gratitude to
Oxford, urged the King to reform the Universities once
more, alleging that otherwise the work of the Revolution
‘would all soon go back.’ William had been recognised
as a deliverer, but Oxford loyalists had not abandoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
their allegiance to the Stuart dynasty, however inconsistent
with their submission to William as king <em>de facto</em>
by the will of a Parliamentary majority. It was not
until the autumn of 1695, after the death of Mary, and
the complete transfer of power to the Whigs, that he
found time to visit the University, for a few hours only,
on his way from Woodstock to Windsor. He was received
by the Chancellor, the second Duke of Ormond,
and one of a family which, as representing the high
Tory aristocracy, held this office, as if by hereditary
right, for a period of ninety years. All the usual ceremonies
were observed; a select body of Doctors and
Masters ‘rode out in their gowns to meet the King’ a
mile on the Woodstock road, and a grand procession
conducted him down the High Street to the east gate of
the schools, through which he passed directly to the
theatre, where a sumptuous banquet was prepared for
him. Evelyn states that, being coldly received, he
declined the banquet and barely stayed an hour; according
to another report, in itself improbable, the fear
of poison deterred him from tasting the refreshments
provided. However this may be, he certainly never
courted or acquired popularity at the University, which
henceforth became a hotbed of Jacobite disaffection for
at least two generations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of
Oxford
Jacobitism.
Visit of
Queen Anne</div>

<p>The exact source of this sentiment is somewhat
difficult to ascertain, but it was probably a survival of
the Puritan Visitation, and was doubtless connected
with hearty respect for the Non-jurors,
to whose ranks, however, Oxford contributed
fewer resident members than Cambridge. But Oxford
Churchmen assuredly cherished a genuine hatred of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
latitudinarian opinions attributed to William III., and
afterwards patronised by Whig statesmen. Whatever
may have been its source, and whether it was in the
nature of a settled conviction or of an inveterate fashion,
Jacobite partisanship was shared alike by ‘dons’ and by
undergraduates, it was the one important element in
the external history of the University under the first
two Georges, and, like Scotch Jacobitism, it retained a
sort of poetical existence up to a still later period. In
their opposition to the Comprehension Scheme promoted
by the King, the University of Oxford was supported by
that of Cambridge, in which there long continued to be
a strong Jacobite minority, but which, by comparison
with Oxford, soon came to be regarded as a nursery of
Whig principles. Still the commission appointed to
prepare a scheme of Comprehension included the names
of Aldrich, afterwards dean of Christchurch, who had
succeeded the Romanist Massey, and Jane, Regius Professor
of divinity, who had been converted from extreme
Toryism by James II.’s aggression on Magdalen, but
was reconverted by William III.’s neglect of his claims
to a bishopric. The hopes of a Jacobite reaction, excited
by the accession of Queen Anne, found an enthusiastic
echo in the University. On July 16, 1702, a
grand ‘Philological Exercise’ was celebrated in the
theatre for the special purpose of honouring the new
Queen. On August 26 of the same year, Queen Anne
herself visited Oxford, where a fierce struggle for precedence
at her reception took place between the University
and City, which afterwards showed more respect for
the Stuart dynasty in exile than when it was on the throne.
Burnet complains bitterly of the clerical Toryism and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
ecclesiastical bigotry which prevailed at Oxford in 1704,
accusing the University of ‘corrupting the principles’
of its students. Hearne, the learned Oxford chronicler,
writing on September 2, 1705, notices a thanksgiving
sermon preached by a Mr. Evans, of St. John’s, a clergyman
of doubtful character, of which Dr. Lloyd, bishop
of Worcester, said that ‘he was very glad there was one
even in Oxford that would speak for King William.’
He adds, three days later, that Evans had talked
mightily of publishing this sermon, but that ‘there is
none in Oxford will print a thing so scandalously partial
against the Church of England.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Popularity

Position
of the
Whig
minority</div>

<p>During the furious outbreak of High Church
fanaticism, which rallied the mass of English clergy and
shattered the Whig ascendency at the end of
1709, the gownsmen were active partisans of
Dr. Sacheverell, himself a graduate of Magdalen.
The vice-chancellor came forward as surety for
him, Atterbury, the future dean of Christchurch, defended
him with great ability, and Oxford afterwards gave
him an enthusiastic reception. The House of Lords
marked its sense of this disloyalty in the following year
by causing the famous University decree of 1683 to be
publicly burned, together with Sacheverell’s sermons.
No sooner did Queen Anne disavow her Whig advisers
and place herself openly under Tory influences, than
Oxford, undeterred by this rebuke, paraded its Toryism
without disguise, and, had it retained its old place in
national politics, the Hanoverian succession would have
encountered a still more formidable opposition. But the
Whig oligarchy again saved the country. After four
years of Tory policy, another crisis occurred, the Tory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
ministry broke up, the great Whig lords forced their
way into the council chamber, the Hanoverian succession
was secured, and Queen Anne opportunely died.
The accession of the Elector of Hanover was received at
Oxford with sullen disappointment, but the Heads of
Houses consulted their own interests by offering a reward
of 100<em>l.</em> for the discovery of an unknown person who
had delivered at the mayor’s house a letter protesting
against the proclamation of George I. He was proclaimed,
nevertheless, at St. Mary’s, as well as at Carfax,
but the scantiness of the attendance and shabbiness of
the procession was remarked with satisfaction by the
Tories. Baffled in their hopes of support in the highest
quarter, the Tory democracy of the University took
refuge in libels, disloyal toasts, and offensive lampoons.
The Whig gownsmen, few as they were, and mostly
confined to New College, Oriel, and Merton, had an
influential protector in Gardiner, the Warden of All
Souls’, and vice-chancellor from 1712 to 1715, himself a
moderate Tory, but resolute in saving the University
from the risk of casting in its lot with the Pretender.
They formed themselves into a club, which they called
the ‘Constitution Club,’ and to which no one below the
rank of B.A. was eligible. This club soon became the
chief object of Tory resentment, at last culminating in a
riot which called for the intervention of the government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jacobite
demonstrations.
A troop of
horse sent
to Oxford</div>

<p>On May 28, 1715, being the first anniversary of
George I.’s birthday since his accession, the Whig club
had assembled to commemorate the day at the King’s
Head tavern. They were attacked by a Tory mob, and
a fray ensued, which broke out afresh on the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
day, being the Restoration-day. The Heads of Houses,
and even the grand jury for the county, sheltered the
aggressors, and reserved all their rebukes for
the obnoxious club. The government naturally
took a different view of the case, and
called for explanations. Feeling that matters,
had gone far enough, the University authorities
took means to suppress Jacobite demonstrations on
June 10, the Pretender’s birthday; but they were at no
pains to conceal their real inclinations. On the impeachment
and resignation of Ormond, the University
hastened to elect his brother, the Earl of Arran, as his
successor in the chancellorship, and conferred the
degree of D.C.L. on Sir Constantine Phipps, a Tory of
Tories, with special marks of honour, while its representatives
in Parliament were prominent leaders of the
same party. At last the patience of the government
was exhausted. On the birthday of the Prince of Wales
there were no signs of rejoicing, and complaint of this
omission was made to the mayor by an officer in command
of a recruiting party then in Oxford. Another
disturbance ensued, of which conflicting accounts were
sent to London, and the whole affair came before the
House of Lords in the course of a debate on the Mutiny
Bill. The University was ably represented, and a
plausible defence was offered on its behalf, but the
verdict of the House was unfavourable. In the meantime,
an address to the Crown voted by the University
on the outbreak of the rebellion in Scotland had met
with the reception which its insincerity deserved, and
the government determined to employ decisive measures.
A body of dragoons under Major-General Pepper entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
Oxford, martial law was at once proclaimed, and the
students were ordered to remain within their colleges on
pain of being marched off to military execution. After
a few seizures had been made, the dragoons were replaced
by Colonel Handyside’s regiment of foot, which
continued to be quartered in Oxford for the express
purpose of overawing the University—no unnecessary
measure when a rebellion of unknown extent had been
planned not only in Scotland and the north of England
but in the western counties. It was on this occasion
that an Oxford wit contrasted the King’s severe treatment
of Oxford with his munificent present of a library
to Cambridge in lines which, together with the Cambridge
repartee, have become historical.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Constitution
Club.
Government
scheme for
reforming
the University</div>

<p>On May 29 of the following year, while Colonel
Handyside’s regiment was still in Oxford, the Constitution
Club was again the scene of a political
commotion, though of a less serious nature.
Meadowcourt, the steward of the club, having
forced the junior proctor to drink the King’s
health, was suspended from his degree for the space of
two years; and it was further ordered that he should
not be allowed to supplicate for his grace ‘until he confesses
his manifold crimes and asks pardon upon his
knees.’ In spite of the King’s Act of Grace, to which he
skilfully appealed, he was twice refused his M.A. degree.
He lived, however, to bring the disaffection of the University
under the notice of the government in 1719,
when the vice-chancellor refused to notice a disloyal
sermon preached by Warton, though he was disappointed
to receive no more than a letter of thanks for
his zeal. Other Whigs endured similar persecutions;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
the Whig satirist, Amherst, was driven out of St. John’s
College, and social penalties were freely inflicted on
members of Merton, Exeter, Christchurch, and Wadham,
then suspected of being anti-Jacobite societies. The
Constitution Club died out before the end of George I.’s
reign, and many academical Whigs became so disheartened
as to conceal their principles or even to affect
Toryism for the sake of preferment. Indeed, the avowed
hostility of Oxford and the doubtful fidelity of Cambridge
to the reigning dynasty were regarded with so
much anxiety at Court that it was seriously contemplated
to introduce a Bill to suspend the constitution of
both Universities. The draught of this Bill empowered
the ‘King to nominate and appoint all and every the
Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, Proctors, and other officers
of the said Universities, and all Heads of Houses, Fellows,
Students, Chaplains, Scholars, and Exhibitioners, and all
members of and in all and every the College and Colleges,
Hall and Halls in the said Universities or either of them,
upon all and every vacancy and vacancies,’ &amp;c. This
provisional administration was to last for seven years,
and the project of it was approved by fifteen bishops.
Lord Macclesfield, the Lord Chancellor, had drawn up a
separate plan of reform with the same object of controlling
the University through government patronage.
The election of Heads was to be vested in the great
officers of State, with the concurrence of the Visitor and
the bishop. The disposition of all other college emoluments
was to be placed in the hands of a commission.
The fellowships were to be limited to a term of twenty
years, lest they should conduce to idleness and self-indulgence.
Professorships and minor fellowships<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
charged with educational duties were to be founded. The
benefices of the Crown and the nobility were to be conferred
only on ‘well-affected persons.’ Colleges in which
‘honest and loyal men’ predominate were to be specially
favoured in the distribution of Crown patronage, ‘till
the true interest in them was become superior to all
opposition.’ Happily wiser counsels prevailed, and
there is reason to believe that Archbishop Wake was
largely instrumental in averting the danger. He knew
that Oxford Tories could only be influenced through
Tory leaders, and discreetly used such mediation to keep
the factious spirit of the University within tolerable
bounds, until the design against its independence was
abandoned. But George I. never deigned to visit
Oxford, being the first sovereign who had failed to do
so since the reign of Mary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gradual
decline of
Jacobitism
in Oxford
during the
reign of
George II.</div>

<p>During the earlier years of Walpole’s administration
the University seems to have been comparatively
free from political turmoil. Many of the
gownsmen, however, took part with the
citizens in the disorderly revels, lasting for
three nights, which celebrated the withdrawal
of the Excise Bill, in 1733, when the healths of Ormond,
Bolingbroke, and James III. were publicly drunk round
the bonfires. On the other hand, in the following year
the University accorded an enthusiastic reception to
the Prince of Orange, who came to marry the Princess
Anne. The city shared in these festivities, conferring
its freedom upon the prince at the north gate on his
return from Blenheim, while bell-ringing, illuminations,
and bonfires were kept up for three nights together.
Still covert Jacobitism found expression in the University<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
pulpit, and John Wesley, desiring to guard
himself against the imputation of it when he preached
before the University in 1734, got the vice-chancellor to
read and approve his sermon beforehand. Even after
the suppression of the rebellion in 1745 it was not extinct,
and in 1748 the government resorted to somewhat
excessive severity against three students who had
toasted the Pretender, although the vice-chancellor and
proctors, apprehensive of the result, had issued a
peremptory order declaring their resolution to put
down seditious practices. Further proceedings were
instituted against the vice-chancellor and the University
itself, but the motion was negatived by the Court. The
government, however, was not appeased. When the
peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was proclaimed at Oxford, the
vice-chancellor, Heads of Houses, professors, and proctors
took care to participate in public rejoicings with the
mayor and corporation, but a congratulatory address
from the University on this event was rejected with
disdain. The loyalty of the University was still justly
distrusted. In 1754 Dr. King, a notorious Jacobite,
and Principal of St. Mary Hall, elicited rounds of
applause from the whole audience in the theatre, filled
with peers, members of Parliament, and country gentlemen,
by thrice pausing upon the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Redeat</i>, purposely
introduced into his speech to gratify ‘the Old Interest.’
No wonder that in the same year Pitt denounced Oxford
Jacobitism in the House of Commons; notwithstanding
which, in the following year (1755), a Tory
and Jacobite mob, guarding the approaches to the
polling-booths at the county election for days together,
prevented the Whigs from giving their votes. Again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
in 1759, Lord Westmoreland, who had been a zealous
Hanoverian, but had afterwards turned Jacobite out of
resentment against Sir Robert Walpole, was elected by
the University as its Chancellor. Yet the days of Oxford
Jacobitism were already numbered; it was well nigh
dead as a creed, and it soon ceased to be a fashion. The
marvellous victories of the same year kindled genuine
enthusiasm among the gownsmen, and a most fulsome
address was presented to George II. by the Oxford
Convocation, begging ‘leave to approach your sacred
person with hearts full of duty and affection,’ and
applauding the measures taken ‘for the support of the
Protestant religion and the liberties of Europe.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revival of
loyalty after
the accession
of
George III.
His visits to
Oxford</div>

<p>With the accession of George III. Jacobitism disappeared
or faded into Toryism of the modern type. In
its congratulatory address the University took
special credit to itself for having been ‘ever
faithful to monarchy on the most trying occasions.’
The King’s reply was guarded, recommending
‘sound principles of religious and civil duties
early instilled into the minds of youth.’ His advice
seems to have been adopted; at all events, we hear no
more of academical Jacobitism, loyalty to George III.
became fashionable, Dr. King himself appeared at Court,
and the University was probably sincere when, in 1763,
it proposed inviolable ‘attachment to your Majesty’s
person and government.’ It may perhaps have been in
recognition of this salutary change in its attitude that
in 1768 the Speaker of the House of Commons paid it
an elaborate compliment, in censuring the authorities
of Oxford City for a gross act of political corruption,
specially recommending for imitation the conduct of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
their learned neighbour. In the following year, the
University presented another address to the Crown
deprecating political agitation ‘under pretence of
defending civil and religious liberties,’ and assuring his
Majesty of its determination to imbue its students with
sound principles. By a happy inconsistency, academical
loyalists now managed to reconcile their old worship of
the king <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure</i> with a hearty acceptance of the Hanoverian
succession. Probably Dr. Nowell, Principal of
St. Mary Hall, fairly represented these sentiments when
he reasserted the doctrines of divine right and passive
obedience in a sermon preached before the House of
Commons in 1772, for which he was first thanked and
then censured. It deserves notice, however, that a more
liberal spirit already made itself felt in regard to
religious toleration. Though Sir Roger Newdigate, on
behalf of the University, stoutly opposed the relief of
clergymen from subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles,
a strong minority in the Oxford Convocation supported,
in February 1773, a proposal for requiring from candidates
for matriculation only a declaration of conformity
to the worship and liturgy of the Established Church.
An attempt was afterwards made to qualify the effect of
subscription by appending to the statute requiring it an
explanatory note whereby it was virtually reduced to a
declaration of conformity, but the legal validity of such
an enactment was challenged, and the proposal was
quietly dropped. In March 1779, a petition was presented
by the University, through its chancellor, Lord
North, against the Dissenters’ Toleration Bill, then
before Parliament. This petition embodied a protest
against the principle of allowing dissenting ministers
and schoolmasters to preach and teach without making
any profession of belief in Christianity or revelation, but
the petitioners were careful to describe themselves as
friends of toleration, so far as it could be reconciled with
the interests of Christianity and the Established Church.
These were the sentiments of the King himself, and a
crowning proof of its fidelity to George III. was given
by the University in 1783, when it publicly thanked
the King for dismissing the Coalition Ministry (including
its own Chancellor), and giving his confidence to Pitt—a
service which the king rewarded by visiting Oxford
twice from Nuneham Park, in 1785 and 1786. On
each occasion he received an enthusiastic welcome,
but as it was in the middle of the Long Vacation, he
stayed but a few hours, and the traditional solemnities
of royal visits were not repeated. A like enthusiasm
was shown by the University on his recovery from his
first illness in 1788.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Decay of
University
education in
the eighteenth
century</div>

<p class="no-indent">If we seek to estimate the intellectual life of Oxford
during the century following the Revolution, we find a
significant dearth of trustworthy materials.
Such evidence as we possess, however, justifies
on the whole the received opinion that this
period is the Dark Age of academical history.
The impulse given to culture and scholarship by the
new learning of the Renaissance had died away as completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
as that given by the scholastic revival of the
thirteenth century, and nothing came in to supply its
place. The old disputations were almost obsolete, the
Laudian system of examinations had fallen into
scandalous abuse, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sex solemnes lectiones</i> required for
the B.A. degree had degenerated into ‘wall lectures’
read in an empty school. The practice of cramming,
however, was unknown, and there were no artificial
restrictions to prevent Oxford becoming a paradise of
mature study and original research.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contemporary
evidence</div>

<p>Unhappily, it was far otherwise. Though undergraduates
were freely admitted to the Bodleian Library,
and it was frequently enriched by donations,
we learn that between 1730 and 1740 many
days passed without there being a single reader
there, and it was rare for more than two books to be
consulted in a day. Dean Prideaux, who had long
resided in Oxford, professes, in 1691, ‘an unconquerable
aversion to the place,’ doubtless aggravated by his impatience
of Jacobite ascendency in the University, but
partly founded on his conviction of its decline as a seat
of education. Hearne, writing in 1726, declared that
in nearly all the colleges the fellows were busied in
litigation and quarrels having no connection with the
promotion of learning, adding that ‘good letters miserably
decay every day, insomuch that this Ordination
on Trinity Sunday at Oxford there were no fewer (as I
am informed) than fifteen denied Orders for insufficiency—which
is the more to be noted, because our bishops
and those employed by them are themselves generally
illiterate men.’ Similar complaints against the degeneracy
of University teaching abound in eighteenth-century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
literature. Adam Smith, in particular, attributes
the inefficiency of tutors and professors chiefly to
the fact of their being paid by fixed stipends instead of
by fees. Johnson testifies that he learned very little
at Pembroke College; Lord Malmesbury regarded his
two years at Merton College as the most unprofitable of
his life; Swift represents drinking strong ale and
smoking tobacco as the chief accomplishments—not
indeed of all students, but of ‘young heirs’ sent to
Oxford in deference to custom; Lord Chesterfield speaks
of the University as known only for its ‘treasonable
spirit,’ and says that, having been at Oxford himself, he
resolved not to send his son there; Lord Eldon describes
the degree-examination in his own time as merely
nominal. But perhaps the most emphatic condemnation
of the Oxford system in the eighteenth century is
supplied by the historian Gibbon, whose reminiscences
of his own University career are often quoted as conclusive
evidence on the state of the University in 1752-3.
He laments the fourteen months which he spent at
Magdalen College as the ‘most idle and unprofitable of
his whole life.’ He declares that ‘in the University of
Oxford, the greater part of the Public Professors have
for these many years given up even the pretence of
teaching.’ He testifies that, in his time, ‘the Fellows of
Magdalen were decent easy men who supinely enjoyed
the gifts of the Founder; their days were filled by a
series of uniform employments: the chapel and the hall,
the coffee-house and the common-room; till they retired,
weary and well-satisfied, to a long slumber. From the
toil of reading, or thinking, or writing, they had absolved
their conscience.’ He proceeds to allege that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
gentlemen-commoners were left to educate themselves,
that ‘the obvious methods of public exercises and examinations
were totally unknown,’ that no superintendence
was exercised over the relations of tutors with their
pupils, that his own tutor, though a good old-fashioned
scholar, took no pains to stimulate or encourage his
industry, and that he was allowed to make ‘a tour to
Bath, a visit into Buckinghamshire, and four excursions
into London, in the same winter.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decline in
numbers and
dearth of
eminence in
science and
literature</div>

<p>We cannot but acknowledge that Gibbon’s estimate
of the University in the middle of the century is confirmed
by an examination of University records.
If we may judge by the statistics of matriculation,
the nation at large had lost confidence
in Oxford education, for the annual number
of admissions, which had often exceeded 300 in the
reigns of Anne and George I., never reached that
modest total between 1726 and 1810, while it often fell
below 200 about the end of George II.’s reign. It is
equally certain that Oxford contributed far less than in
former ages to politics or literature. In learning it was
distanced by Cambridge, where the modern examination
system was developed earlier, and where the immortal
researches of Newton and the solid learning of Bentley
had raised the ideal of academical study. But the real
intellectual leadership of the country was transferred
from both Universities to London. Indeed, London
itself was no longer the only non-academical centre of
science, art, and culture; for even provincial towns,
like Birmingham and Manchester, Derby and Bristol,
Norwich, Leeds, and Newcastle, were already acquiring
an industrial independence, and intellectual life, of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
own. The Methodist Revival, indeed, of which Gibbon
was probably unconscious, owed its origin to a small
band of enthusiasts at Oxford.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> But, except Methodism,
the great movements of thought which underlay the
artificial society of the eighteenth century had no connection
with the University, and the minds which
dominated the world of politics and literature were
trained in a wholly different school. The broad constructive
ideas, and ‘encyclopædic spirit,’ as it has been
well called, which animated so many writers and politicians
of that age, in all the countries of western Europe,
had little or no place in the University of Oxford. It
was hardly to be expected that engineers and inventors,
like Watt, Arkwright, and Brindley, should have received
an University education, nor do we look in degree-lists
for the names of eminent soldiers like Wellington,
or nautical explorers like Cook. But it is certainly remarkable
that so many English poets and humourists—Pope
and Gay, Defoe, Smollett, and Hogarth—should
have received no University education, while Swift,
Congreve, and Goldsmith were students of Dublin,
Thomson of Edinburgh, Fielding of Leyden, Prior,
Sterne, and Gray, of Cambridge. Again, if we look to
graver departments of literature, or the history of
science, the result is still the same. Robertson was
educated at Glasgow, Hume in France, Berkeley in
Dublin; Herschel and Priestley owed nothing to University
education, nor did John Howard, or Joshua
Reynolds, or John Wilkes, or many others who powerfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
influenced the minds of the Georgian era. Jeremy
Bentham, it is true, received a part of his education
at Queen’s College, but he carried away no kindly recollection
of his college life, and sums up his estimate
of Oxford training in a single acrimonious sentence—‘Mendacity
and insincerity—in these I found the
effects, the sure and only sure effects, of an English
University education.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Counter-evidence
showing that
education
and learning
were not
wholly
neglected</div>

<p>On the other hand, it would be easy to overstate both
the intellectual sterility and the educational torpor of
the University in the century following the
Revolution. The ripe scholarship and academic
wit of Addison may still be appreciated in the
pages of the ‘Spectator,’ and Dr. Parr, in
replying to Gibbon, was able to compile an
imposing list of Oxford graduates in the eighteenth
century ‘distinguished by classical, oriental, theological,
or mathematical knowledge, by professional skill, or by
parliamentary abilities.’ We must remember that when
the historian entered Magdalen College as a gentleman-commoner,
he was in his fifteenth year; when he left
it, he was barely sixteen. The college did not then
bear a high reputation for industry, there were no
commoners, and gentlemen-commoners, being of a different
social class from the ‘demies,’ were supposed
to enjoy the privilege of idleness. Gibbon himself
mentions that Corpus was fortunate in possessing an
admirable tutor in John Burton. He also candidly
admits that Bishop Lowth was a bright exception to
professional sinecurism, and quotes the bishop’s description
of his own academical life, which is too often forgotten,
when Gibbon’s adverse criticism is magnified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
into a judicial utterance. ‘I spent many years,’ says
Lowth, ‘in that illustrious society, in a well-regulated
course of useful discipline and studies ... where a
liberal pursuit of knowledge, and a genuine freedom of
thought, was raised, encouraged, and pushed forward
by example, by commendation, and by authority.’
Moreover, Gibbon allows that his father may have been
unfortunate in the selection of a college and a tutor,
that Sir William Scott’s tutorial, and Blackstone’s professorial,
lectures had done honour to Oxford, that learning
had been made ‘a duty, a pleasure, and even a
fashion’ at Christchurch, and that reforms in the system
of instruction had been effected elsewhere. Lord
Sheffield, the editor of his memoirs, adds further proofs
of the same improvement, and, on the whole, Gibbon’s
testimony must be taken as a somewhat one-sided statement
of a witness strongly prejudiced against the
ecclesiastical character of Oxford, and irritated by the
necessity of quitting it, owing to his conversion to
Romanism. Similar deductions must be made from the
testimony of Bentham, who entered Queen’s in 1760, at
the age of 13, and took his degree, in 1763, at the age
of 16, having cherished a precocious contempt for
juvenile amusements, and a precocious, though reasonable,
objection to signing the XXXIX Articles, in spite
of conscientious doubts.</p>

<p>It is impossible to ascertain how far the admitted
decay of University lectures and examinations was compensated
by college tuition. But it is clear that some
colleges maintained an educational system of their own,
and imposed exercises on their members, often in the
form of declamations or disputations, which stood more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
or less in the place of those formerly required by the
University. At Merton College, for instance, there
were regular hall-disputations, in which even gentlemen-commoners
were expected to bear their part, besides
more solemn disputations in divinity for Bachelors of
Arts, and ‘Variations’ for ‘Master-Fellows’ at the end of
the Act Term. These Variations, as described in a work
published in 1749, do not seem to have possessed any
great educational value, and, according to a contemporary
author, ‘were amicably concluded with a magnificent
and expensive supper, the charges of which formerly
came to 100<em>l.</em>, but of late years much retrenched.’
Such logical encounters were clearly mere survivals or
revivals of mediæval dialectics, but there is some reason
to believe that sounder and more useful knowledge was
quietly cultivated, and rewarded by fellowships, though
not yet recognised by University honours. When John
Wesley was elected a fellow of Lincoln, in 1726, disputations
were held six times a week, as at Merton, but
he formed his own scheme of studies. He allotted
Mondays and Tuesdays to classics; Wednesdays to
logic and ethics; Thursdays to Hebrew and Arabic;
Fridays to metaphysics and natural philosophy; Saturdays
to rhetoric, poetry, and composition; Sundays to
divinity; besides which, he bestowed much attention
on mathematics. Doubtless, John Wesley was no common
man, but he was never regarded as a prodigy of
learning by his fellows, and it was the deliberate opinion
of Johnson, in the next generation, that college tuition
was not the farce which Gibbon imagined it. Speaking
of Oxford in 1768, Dr. Johnson said: ‘There is here,
sir, such a progressive emulation. The students are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
anxious to appear well to their tutors; the tutors are
anxious to have their pupils appear well in the college;
the colleges are anxious to have their students appear
well in the University; and there are excellent rules of
discipline in every college.’ Sir William Jones, who
obtained a scholarship at University College in 1764,
and a fellowship two years later, found means to prosecute
his Oriental researches there, and mapped out his
own time, like Wesley, between different branches of
study. By the statutes of Hertford College, framed in
1747, undergraduates were required to produce a declamation,
theme, or translation every week, composing
it in English during their second and third years, and
in Latin during their fourth. Nor were fellowship-examinations
by any means an unmeaning form in good
colleges. Those at All Souls’ had long been a real test
of intellectual merit, though motives of favouritism
sometimes governed the choice of the electors. At
Merton, in the early part of the eighteenth century,
we read of fellowship-elections being preceded by a
thorough examination, including two days of book-work
in Homer, Xenophon, Lucian, Tacitus, and
Horace, besides a ‘theme,’ doubtless in Latin. When
we find that some two hundred and fifty editions of
classical works, mostly, but not wholly, in the ancient
languages, were published in Oxford during the first
half of the eighteenth century, it is hardly possible to
doubt that many industrious readers must have existed
among the students and fellows of colleges, however
imperfect may have been the organisation of lectures.
Dr. Charlett, the eminent Master of University College,
writing in 1715, was able to praise the youths under
his own charge as ‘sober, modest, and studious,’ nor is
there any reason to doubt that many students in other
colleges deserved a like character. Degenerate as it
was, and far inferior to Cambridge in the performance
of its higher functions, the University was not so utterly
effete as it is sometimes represented. It produced few
great scholars and fewer great teachers, but it was not
wholly unfaithful to its mission of educating the English
clergy and gentry, and the great philosopher,
Berkeley, who had described it as an ideal retreat for
learning and piety, deliberately chose it as his final
home and resting-place.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Stagnation
of University
legislation
in the
eighteenth
century</div>

<p class="no-indent">We may pass lightly over the history of the University
during the latter part of the eighteenth century, when
its external and internal life were equally
barren of memorable events. Only eight statutes
had been enacted by Convocation between
1636 and 1759; nor was the succeeding
period more prolific of reforms. The legislative energy
of the University was confined for the most part to
amendments of mere administrative details, and it was
even suggested that such trifling measures were beyond
its powers. In the year 1759, the right of the University
to abrogate any of the Laudian statutes without the
consent of the Crown was challenged by the proctors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
The objection, however, was overruled, and the principle
was established that, whereas it was not competent
for the University to make any statutes as immutable
as the laws of the Medes and Persians, it could not
delegate any such power to the King himself, so that
any statute made under royal sanction was subject to
repeal, like ordinary bye-laws. In 1770, a new statute
was passed for the regulation of academical habits,
which provoked a long controversy, and incidentally
established the principle, applicable to more important
subjects, that no individual Head of a college, nor even
all the Heads of colleges together, could dispense with
statutable rules, independently of Convocation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Statutes
affecting the
University</div>

<p>Meanwhile, a considerable number of Acts were
passed by Parliament confirming or enlarging the privileges
of the University. For instance, in
1774, the Universities of England and Scotland
were empowered by special enactment to hold in
perpetuity their exclusive right of printing books, the
copyright of which should have been vested in them by
the authors. Other Acts granted colleges special exemptions
from the land tax in respect of their buildings,
and from legacy duty in respect of collections and
other specific articles bequeathed to them. Resident
members of the University were further exempted from
service in the Militia, and the stringent Act of 1799,
‘for better preventing treasonable and seditious practices,’
was expressly limited so as not to curtail the
freedom of University lectures or the University press.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Political
sympathies
of the University
after
the outbreak
of the
French Revolution</div>

<p>In 1793, the installation of the Duke of Portland as
successor to Lord North in the chancellorship was signalised
by festivities on an unprecedented scale, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
a tumultuous struggle for admission to the Sheldonian
Theatre led to a fray which reflected little credit
on academical manners. The hero of the day,
and favourite of the gownsmen, was Edmund
Burke, whose son received an honorary D.C.L.
degree, but who is said to have declined it
for himself on the ground that, in 1790, the Heads
of Houses had negatived a requisition from forty-nine
Masters of Arts proposing that a D.C.L. degree
should be conferred on him ‘by diploma.’ The political
sympathies of the University were, in fact, strongly
called forth on behalf of the Royalist cause in France,
and a large subscription was raised in 1792 for the
relief of the French refugees, especially Catholic priests,
three of whom settled at Oxford. Tn 1794 nearly
2,500<em>l.</em> was contributed for purposes of national defence
by the resident body of graduates, including a grant of
200<em>l.</em> from the University chest. In 1798, a further
contribution of 4,000<em>l.</em> ‘in aid of the revenue of the
country’ was sent to the government from the University
and colleges of Oxford, while an University volunteer
corps, mustering about five hundred men, was
formed and drilled, as in the days of the Civil War.
This martial ardour, and the drain of students into the
army, doubtless contributed to increase the depression
of academical studies which preceded and rendered necessary
the ‘new examination statutes’ of 1800. But
academical studies must also have suffered from the
prevailing distress which marked the winter of 1799,
when bread-riots took place in Oxford, and large subscriptions
were raised in the University for the relief of
the poor townspeople.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Accessions
to professoriate
in the
eighteenth
century</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the decline of academical vigour
during the eighteenth century, both the professorial
staff and the public buildings of the University
received a considerable extension. In 1708
the Professorship of Poetry was founded out
of funds bequeathed for the purpose by Henry Birkhead.
In 1724 the Regius Professorship of Modern
History was established by George I. In 1728 the
Professorship of Botany, then in a state of suspended
animation, was re-endowed out of the munificent
bequest of William Sherard. In 1749 the first Professor
of Experimental Philosophy was appointed, with a
salary of 30<em>l.</em>, out of the Crewe benefaction. In 1758
the bequest of Charles Viner took effect by the election
of William Blackstone to the new Vinerian Professorship
of Common Law. In 1780 the Clinical Professorship
was founded in connection with the Radcliffe
Infirmary. In 1795 the Professorship of Anglo-Saxon
was constituted, forty years after the death of its
founder, Dr. Rawlinson, the famous antiquary, and in
1798 George Aldrich, formerly of Merton College,
bequeathed property for the endowment of Professorships
in Anatomy, Medicine, and Chemistry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Architectural
improvements</div>

<p>Meanwhile the mediæval aspect of Oxford was modified
by many new architectural features. Early in the
century additional buildings sprang up in
Magdalen, Corpus, Queen’s, and Oriel. To
the same age belong the Codrington Library at All
Souls’, with the new Library and Peckwater Quadrangle
at Christchurch, and other college buildings. In 1713
the Clarendon Building was opened to receive the
University Press. Books had been printed in Oxford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
since 1468, when Caxton’s invention was still on its
trial, but Delegates of the Press were not appointed
until 1586, and the University privilege of printing
dates from the patent granted in 1633, at the instance
of Archbishop Laud. After 1669 the University Press
was set up and worked in the Sheldonian Theatre, but
the copyright of Clarendon’s ‘History of the Rebellion’
having been presented to the University, the profits
were applied towards the cost of erecting the fine edifice
known as the ‘Clarendon Press’ for 118 years. A
still more important benefaction was that of the celebrated
Dr. Radcliffe, who died in 1714, leaving a large
sum of money to be accumulated for the foundation of a
Medical Library, an Infirmary, and an Observatory. The
first stone of the library was laid in 1737, all the houses
in ‘Cat Street,’ north of St. Mary’s Church, having been
demolished to make room for it. It was opened for the
use of students on April 13, 1749, after a ‘two days’
solemnity,’ including a Public Act, and a concert managed
by Handel, whose oratorios had been received
with great applause at Oxford six years earlier, and
whose ‘Sampson’ was performed in the Sheldonian
Theatre on the following day. The Infirmary and
Observatory were completed in 1770 and 1795 respectively,
but are not under University control, though
closely associated with University studies. In 1788
Sir Robert Taylor, an architect of some eminence,
bequeathed a large sum to found a building for the
cultivation of ‘the European languages,’ but this bequest
did not take full effect until 1848, when the
present ‘Taylor Institution’ was opened. Meanwhile,
in 1771, an Act of Parliament had been passed enabling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
the City to rebuild Magdalen Bridge, and take down
the east and north gates, the south and west gates
having been already demolished. By these alterations
the conversion of Oxford into an University town was
finally consummated, and few of its inhabitants now
realise that it was once a fortified city sheltering a
cluster of poor schools and halls not yet aspiring to the
dignity of colleges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
the French
war upon
the University.
Opposition
to
reforms</div>

<p>The general history of the University in the present
century may be divided into two periods: the first terminated
by the Reform Act of 1832, and the
great ecclesiastical reaction which followed
upon it; the second embracing the last two or
three years of William IV.’s reign, and the
whole reign of Queen Victoria. The new Examination
Statute of 1800, and the subsequent introduction of the
class system,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> were the only events of any academical
importance in the earlier of these periods, and nothing
occurred to disturb the repose of the University
during the last twenty years of George III.’s reign, or
the ten years’ reign of George IV. The domestic
records of this interval are meagre and trivial in the
extreme. When the Peace of Amiens was proclaimed
in 1802, there seems to have been a short-lived revival
of educational vigour at Oxford; when the war broke out
afresh in 1803 volunteers were again enrolled from the
University, and Oxford studies again began to languish.
In 1805 these were vigorously attacked by Sydney
Smith in the ‘Edinburgh Review,’ and vigorously
defended by Mr. Copleston, afterwards Provost of Oriel,
himself among the foremost of University reformers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
While the country was engaged in its desperate struggle
with Napoleon, the ‘class system’ was being quietly
introduced, and supplying a new incentive to industry.
The political animosities which had agitated the University
in the last century had completely died out, but
it is certain that Oxford was profoundly affected by the
anti-Jacobin panic which set in after the French Revolution
and lasted for a whole generation. It is, however,
some proof of a latent inclination to moderate
Liberalism among Oxford graduates that in 1809 Lord
Grenville was elected Chancellor after a contest with
Lord Eldon. On the other hand, the sympathies of the
University on all ‘Church and State’ questions were
identical with those of George III. So far back as
1810 a petition was presented against Catholic Emancipation,
and when Robert Peel was elected member for
the University in 1817, it was fully understood that he
was to oppose the Catholic Claims. In 1829, the University
Convocation reaffirmed its reprobation of these
claims by a solemn vote. Peel resigned his seat, and
upon a new election was defeated by Sir Robert Inglis.
In a like spirit the University petitioned in 1831 against
Parliamentary Reform, in 1833 against the Irish Church
Temporalities Bill, and in 1834, with only one dissentient,
against the grant of a charter to the new London
University. No doubt, in this last case the instinctive
hostility of Churchmen to a non-religious academical
body was quickened by a less honourable jealousy of a
rival institution to be invested with the power of granting
degrees. In spite of the Oxford protest, the charter
was granted at the close of 1836, and in the following
year a similar privilege was conferred upon Durham
University.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reception of
the Allied
Sovereigns.
Abolition of
the Mayor’s
Oath</div>

<p>Two other incidents in University life during this
somewhat obscure period deserve a passing notice. In
1814 Oxford was enlivened by the famous visit
of the Allied Sovereigns, when Blucher was
received with enthusiastic plaudits in the Sheldonian
Theatre. Had the loyalty of the University
been doubtful, the Prince Regent must have been
reassured by the fervent display of it on this occasion; but
these royal visits had lost their significance when the
adhesion of Oxford ceased to be a factor in Imperial
politics, and the subsequent receptions of Queen Adelaide
and Queen Victoria, though almost as hearty as that of
Queen Elizabeth, were tributes of respectful homage
and not of political devotion. In 1825 the mayor and
bailiffs of Oxford were released by a document under
the University seal from the penance laid upon them
after the great riot on Scholastica’s Day in 1354, when
they were required, as we have seen, to attend St.
Mary’s Church yearly with sixty leading citizens, to
celebrate a mass for the souls of the murdered scholars,
and to offer one penny each at the altar. No sooner
was the Sacrifice of the Mass forbidden in the reign of
Elizabeth than the citizens hastened to give up this
annual appearance, but were compelled to resume it by
an Order of Council, a litany being substituted for the
mass. The whole ceremony was now abolished; but
another grievance of earlier origin still remained, and
was not finally removed until the year 1859. By the
letters patent of Henry III., already mentioned, dated
1248, the mayor and bailiffs, on taking office, were
directed to swear that they would keep ‘the liberties
and customs of the University,’ the Chancellor having
been previously informed, in order that he might witness
the oath personally or by a deputy. This obligation,
though it may have been sometimes evaded, does not
seem to have been disputed for more than six centuries.
In 1855, however, the mayor and corporation requested
the University to dispense with the oath. The University
at first demurred, but after friendly conferences
gave its sanction to a Bill for abolishing the oath, upon
condition, however, of its being once more taken by the
mayor and sheriff for the last time. In 1859 this Bill,
introduced at the instance of the City, but with the concurrence
of the University, was passed into law, and the
standing feud so long maintained between these ancient
corporations was thus brought to an amicable conclusion.
The harmony which has since prevailed between
the authorities of the University and the City may have
been partly due to other causes, but it has certainly
been promoted by the disuse of a humiliating formality,
well calculated to revive the memory of barbarous
violence on one side and invidious pretensions on the
other.</p>

CENTURY.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Examination
Statute of
1800 and
later
amendments</div>

<p class="no-indent">‘The studies of the University were first raised from
their abject state by a statute passed in 1800.’ Such
is the testimony of the Oxford University Commissioners
appointed in 1850, and it is amply confirmed by
University records. The Laudian system was doomed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
failure from the first, inasmuch as it provided no security
for the capacity of examiners or against their
collusion with the candidates, while these were
animated by little fear of rejection and no
hope whatever of distinction. The statute of 1800, for
which the credit is mainly due to Dr. Eveleigh, then
Provost of Oriel, was directed to cure these defects.
That it was regarded as a vigorous attempt to raise the
standard of degree examinations is proved by the fact
that in 1801, the last year of the ‘old system,’ the number
of B.A. degrees suddenly rose to 250, largely exceeding
the average of degrees and even of matriculations in
several preceding years. The new statute was deliberately
based on the Laudian system, in so far as it
presupposed an inherent supremacy in the faculty of
Arts, and it was unconsciously based on the old
mediæval curriculum of Trivials and Quadrivials, in so
far as it specified grammar, rhetoric, logic, moral
philosophy, and the elements of mathematics—with the
important addition of Latin and Greek literature—as
the essential subjects of examination. But it effected a
grand reform in the method of examination. Candidates
were to offer themselves either for what has since
been known as a ‘pass,’ or for Honours, and the Honour-list
was to be divided into two classes, in which the
names were to be arranged in order of merit. There was
also to be a further examination for the M.A. degree,
comprising higher mathematical subjects, history, and
Hebrew; while candidates for the B.C.L. degree were
to be examined in history and jurisprudence, besides
the subjects required for the B.A. degree. Moreover,
the examiners were thenceforth to be paid by salary,
and chosen by responsible officers to serve for considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
periods. They were solemnly charged to deliberate
maturely and secretly on the merits of the
candidates, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sepositis omnino amicitiâ et odio, timore
ac spe</i>. Material changes were introduced into this
system by statutes of 1807, modified again in 1809,
1825, 1826, and 1830. The general effect of these
changes was to substitute, in the main, written papers
for oral questions, to establish two stated times in
the year for examination, to subdivide the list of
honours into three classes, to relegate mathematics to a
‘School’ by itself, to abrogate the examination for the
M.A. degree, and to make the Greek and Latin languages,
philosophy, and history, the staple of examination
in what now came to be called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Literæ Humaniores</i>
School, though permission was given to illustrate the
ancient by modern authors. Meanwhile, the old
scholastic exercise of Responsions <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in Parviso</i> was replaced
by an elementary examination, bearing the same
name, to be passed in the second year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Examination
Statute of
1850 and
later
amendments</div>

<p>Such was the Oxford examination-system when it
was transformed afresh in 1850, by a statute which has
been amended and extended by many supplementary
measures. A ‘First Public Examination,’
popularly known as ‘Moderations,’
was interposed between Responsions and the final
examination for the B.A. degree, thenceforth officially
designated the ‘Second Public Examination.’ This
intermediate examination, in which honours are awarded,
was specially designed to encourage and test a scholarlike
knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages,
ancient history, philosophy, and logic being mainly
reserved for the Final Classical, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Literæ Humaniores</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
School. The Honour School of Mathematics was retained,
and two new Schools were established, the one
for Natural Science, the other for Law and Modern
History. This last School was afterwards divided into
two schools, of Jurisprudence and of Modern History,
respectively, while a sixth Honour School was added for
Theology. Until the year 1883, two examinations were
held annually in each of the six Honour Schools, but in
and since that year one only has been held, and that in
Trinity Term. Two examinations, however, continued
to be held annually for candidates seeking an ordinary
degree, and these ‘pass examinations’ were subdivided into
several branches, for the purpose of securing a tolerable
degree of proficiency in more than one subject of study.</p>

<div class="sidenote">University
Commission
of 1850</div>

<p>The important examination statutes of 1850 were in
contemplation, but not yet in operation, when a Royal
Commission was issued, on August 31, in that
year, ‘for the purpose of inquiring into the
state, discipline, studies, and revenues’ of the University
and colleges. The report of this Commission is the most
comprehensive review of the whole University system
which has ever been published. It recommended
various important reforms, of which some were effected
by an Act of Parliament enacted in 1854, and others
through Ordinances framed by executive commissioners,
therein appointed, for the several colleges. In 1850, the
sole initiative power in University legislation, and by far
the largest share of University administration, was still
vested in the ‘Hebdomadal Board,’ consisting solely of
heads of colleges with the two proctors, and described
by no unfriendly critic of Oxford institutions as ‘an
organised torpor.’ The assembly of resident and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
‘regent’ Masters of Arts, known as the ‘House of Congregation,’
still existed for the purpose of granting
degrees, but its other business had dwindled to mere
formalities. The University Convocation included, as
ever, all Masters of Arts, resident or non-resident, and
had the right of debating, but this right was virtually
annulled by the necessity of speaking in Latin—all but
a lost art—and Convocation could only accept or reject
without amendment measures proposed by the Hebdomadal
Board. No student could be a member of the
University without belonging to a college or hall, while
every member of a college or hall was compelled to sleep
within its walls, until after his third year of residence.
Persons unable to sign the Thirty-nine Articles were
absolutely excluded, not merely from degrees, but from
all access to the University, inasmuch as the test of
subscription was enforced at matriculation. Nevertheless,
college fellowships were further protected against
the intrusion of dissenters by the declaration of conformity
to the liturgy required to be made under the
Act of Uniformity. If professorial lectures were not
at so low an ebb as in the days of Gibbon, they were
lamentably scarce and ineffective. The educational
function of the University had, in fact, been almost
wholly merged in college tuition, but the scholarships,
as well as the fellowships, of the colleges were fettered
by all manner of restrictions, which marred their value
as incentives to industry. The great majority of fellows
were bound to take Holy Orders, and the whole
University was dominated by a clerical spirit, which
directly tended to make it, as it had so long been, a
focus of theological controversy.</p>

<p>Though several of the wise and liberal measures
recommended by the Commission of 1850 were postponed
to a more convenient season, a profound and most
beneficial reform was wrought in the whole spirit and
working of the University system by the Act
of 1854, and the College Ordinances framed
under its provisions. The Hebdomadal Board
was replaced by an elective Council, on which Heads of
colleges, professors, and resident Masters of Arts were
equally represented. A new ‘Congregation’ was created,
embracing all resident members of Convocation, and
soon became a vigorous deliberative assembly, with the
right of speaking in English. The monopoly of colleges
was broken down, and an opening made for ulterior
extension by the revival of private halls. The professoriate
was considerably increased, reorganised, and
re-endowed, by means of contributions from colleges.
The colleges were emancipated from their mediæval
statutes, were invested with new constitutions, and
acquired new legislative powers. The fellowships were
almost universally thrown open to merit, and the effect
of this was not merely to provide ample rewards for the
highest academical attainments, but to place the governing
power within colleges in the hands of able men,
likely to promote further improvements. The number
and value of scholarships was largely augmented, and
many, though not all, of the restrictions upon them
were abolished. The great mass of vexatious and obsolete
oaths was swept away, and though candidates for
the M.A. degree and persons elected to fellowships were
still required to make the old subscriptions and declarations,
it was enacted that no religious test should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
imposed at matriculation, or on taking a bachelor’s
degree. The University itself had supplemented the
extension of its curriculum and examination system by
the foundation of a new museum specially consecrated
to natural science. The permanence of this extension
was, however, additionally secured by a clause introduced
into the College Ordinances, whereby it was
directed that fellowships should be appropriated, from
time to time, for the encouragement of all the studies
recognised by the University.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of
these reforms</div>

<p>Other salutary changes naturally grew out of this
comprehensive reform, and far greater progress was
made by the University during the thirty
years immediately following it than in any
previous century of its history. The impulse given to
education reacted upon learning and research; Oxford
science began once more to command the respect of
Europe; the professoriate received an accession of illustrious
names; and college tuition, instead of being
the mere temporary vocation of fellows waiting for
livings, gradually placed itself on the footing of a regular
profession. Instead of drying up the bounty of founders,
as had been confidently predicted, the reforms of 1854
apparently caused the stream of benefactions to flow
with renewed abundance. Nearly all the older colleges
have extended their buildings, mostly by the aid of
private munificence, a new college has been erected, bearing
the name of the Rev. John Keble, and Magdalen Hall
has been refounded, under its original name of Hertford
College, with a large new endowment, provided by Mr.
C. Baring. Meanwhile, a new class of ‘unattached’ or
‘non-collegiate’ students has been created, the number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
which rose to 284 in the year 1880, though it has since
manifested a tendency to fall. The aggregate strength
of the University has been doubled within the same
period of thirty-two years, and the net total of undergraduates
in residence has been swelled from about 1,300
to upwards of 2,500, and the annual matriculations
have increased in a like proportion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Abolition of
University
Tests</div>

<p>The relaxation of the ‘classical monopoly’ and the
opening of scholarships was supplemented, in 1871, by
a still more important reform—the complete
abolition of University Tests, already reduced
by the Act of 1854. This great concession to religious
liberty was brought about by a persistent movement
chiefly emanating from the Universities themselves.
In the year 1862 a petition was presented from 74
resident fellows of colleges at Cambridge, praying for
a repeal of the clause applicable to fellowships in the
Act of Uniformity. In the year 1863, a petition
was presented from 106 Heads, professors, fellows,
ex-fellows, and college tutors at Oxford, praying for
the removal of all theological restrictions on degrees.
In the year 1868, a petition against all religious tests,
except for degrees in theology, was signed by 80 Heads,
professors, lecturers, and resident fellows at Oxford, while
a similar petition was signed by 123 non-resident
fellows and ex-fellows. In the same year a petition to
the same effect was signed by 227 heads and present or
former office-holders and fellows of Cambridge. Separate
petitions, specially directed against the declaration
of conformity, were presented by Trinity and Christ’s
Colleges at Cambridge. Supported by the whole Nonconformist
body and by the Liberal party in Parliament,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
these efforts were ultimately successful. The contest in
Parliament lasted no less than nine years, and one Bill
after another was defeated or withdrawn, but in 1871
the abolition of University Tests was adopted as a
government measure and accepted by the House of
Lords. Experience has not justified the fears of its
opponents, and neither the religious character nor the
social peace of the University has been in the slightest
degree impaired by the admission of Nonconformists to
its degrees and endowments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Local examinations,
and board
for examination
of public
schools</div>

<p>But the impulse given to academical education by
the legislation of 1854 is not to be measured solely by
the internal growth of the University, now
accessible to every class in the nation. Since
that period it has initiated and carried out
two educational movements of national importance,
the one in concert, the other in friendly rivalry,
with the University of Cambridge. The first of these
was the scheme of local examinations for pupils of
middle-class schools, established by a statute passed at
Oxford in 1857, afterwards adopted by Cambridge, and
now exercising a regulative influence on middle-class
education throughout England. The examination of
public schools by a joint-board representing the two
Universities was originated in 1873, and was doubtless
facilitated by the fear, then prevalent, of State-inspection
being applied to endowed schools. At these examinations
certificates are granted, which, under certain
limitations, carry with them an exemption from Responsions
at Oxford, as well as from a part of the ‘previous
examinations’ at Cambridge, and of the military examinations.
Such certificates may be regarded as supplying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
the rudiments of a missing link not only between
secondary and University education, but also between
secondary and professional education.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commission
of inquiry
(1872) and
Act of 1876</div>

<p>In the meantime, a new wave of democratic sentiment
in Parliament impelled Mr. Gladstone to issue, in
January 1872, a commission to inquire into
academical property and revenues, as a preliminary
step to further legislation. The functions
of this commission were strictly limited to investigation
and to matters of finance, no power being
entrusted to it either of passing judgment on the actual
application of University and college funds, or of suggesting
a better application of them—much less of
entering on general questions of University reform.
These questions were destined to be reopened, and a
fresh appropriation of academical endowments to be
made, by the Conservative Government which came into
office in the spring of 1874. At this period the system
established by the Oxford Reform Act of 1854, and the
executive commission thereby appointed, had barely
taken root, but a vigorous agitation was already in progress
against it, mainly on the ground that it had done
too much for educational competition and too little for
learning or research. The principle upon which a fresh
commission was now demanded was not so much the
expediency of redistributing college revenues for the
benefit of the colleges themselves, as the expediency of
diverting them from the colleges to the University,
especially in the interests of Natural Science. The
Marquis of Salisbury, as Chancellor of the University
and an important member of the government, heartily
espoused these claims, and introduced a Bill expressly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
designed to enrich the University at the expense of the
colleges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commission
of 1877</div>

<p>This Bill was passed, with some amendments, in
1877. Its preamble recited the expediency of making
larger provision out of college revenues for
University purposes. It proceeded to institute
an executive commission, armed with sweeping powers
of revision and legislation; but, as a safeguard for the
interests of colleges, it gave each college, not indeed a
veto upon the statutes to be framed, but a share in
framing them, by means of elected representatives, associated
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tempore</i> with the commissioners. It further
enjoined that in assessing contributions on colleges,
regard should first be had to the educational wants
of the college itself. Accordingly, the commissioners
sat for several years, and elaborated an entirely new
code both for the University and for the colleges, repealing
all previous college statutes or ordinances, but
leaving the legislative constitution of the University
untouched. They charged the colleges with an aggregate
subsidy of 20,000<em>l.</em> and upwards for the endowment
of professorships and readerships or lectureships, the
contributions of wealthy colleges being fixed on a higher
scale than those of poorer colleges. By the same
process they set free a certain amount of University
income for such objects as the maintenance of buildings
and libraries. They regulated the payment, duties, and
appointment of professors and readers, as well as the
nomination of University examiners, which had been
subjected to much criticism. They made some approach
towards an organisation of University teaching, by
grouping studies roughly under Faculties, and giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
‘Boards of Faculties’ a certain limited control over the
distribution of lectures. They formulated extremely
minute rules for the publication of University and college
accounts. They remodelled the whole system of college
fellowships, attaching the greater number of them to
University or college offices, but retaining about one
hundred sinecure fellowships, terminable in seven
years, with an uniform stipend of 200<em>l.</em> a year, and subject
to no obligations of residence or celibacy. With
certain exceptions, they abolished all clerical restrictions
on fellowships or headships, but regulated various details
of college management and tuition which the former
commissioners had left in the discretion of each governing
body. They established an uniform standard of
age and value for college scholarships, requiring, as a
rule, that no candidate should have exceeded nineteen,
and that no scholarship should be worth more than 80<em>l.</em>
annually. They also provided for the appropriation of
any surplus revenues which should accrue, to college or
University purposes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of last
reforms</div>

<p>It is too soon to pronounce a judgment on the effect
of these reforms, some of which have not yet come into
full operation, and which have been supplemented
by incessant changes in the examination
statutes, made by the University itself. Indeed,
notwithstanding the bold amendments which it has
undergone, the constitution and educational system of
the University must be regarded as still in a state of
transition. It has ceased to be a mere aggregate of
colleges, but it has not ceased to be essentially collegiate
in many parts of its organisation, and the dualism of
the professorial and tutorial systems has been perpetuated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
Professorships have been freely created, but attendance
on their lectures has not been made obligatory,
and it has been found easier to provide them with
salaries out of college revenues than to provide them
with audiences at the expense of college lecturers. The
number of necessary examinations has been increased,
and many obstacles have been thrown in the way of
persistent idleness; but the door of the University has
not been closed against complete ignorance by an
effective entrance examination, and a dunce ignorant of
his letters may still matriculate and reside, if he can
find a college to admit him. The student is free to
choose his Final School, and, unless he chooses the
Classical School, he may abandon Latin and Greek, in
any case, after Moderations. But a minimum proficiency
in these languages is still necessary for Responsions
as well as for Moderations, several alternatives
for which have been offered with an utter disregard of
symmetry or equality between studies. Women have
been admitted to certain University examinations, but
not to all, nor on the same terms as men; and the
names of those who obtain honours are published in a
class-list, but not the ordinary class-list. Religious
equality has been established for most purposes, but not
for all, and the Faculty of Theology maintains its exclusive
connection not only with the Anglican Church
but with the Anglican clergy. Such are some of the
anomalies which have been left to adjust themselves by
successive commissions and successive groups of University
legislators. They have not proved inconsistent
with a vigorous internal life, but while they exist and
continue to be multiplied, the University cannot be said
to have attained a state of stable equilibrium, nor can a
poetical unity be imparted to an historical narrative of
recent University reforms.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE NEO-CATHOLIC REVIVAL, KNOWN AS THE ‘OXFORD
MOVEMENT.’</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of the
‘Oxford
Movement’</div>

<p class="no-indent">The great Neo-Catholic Revival of the nineteenth century
is so intimately identified with Oxford that it
came to be widely known as the ‘Oxford
Movement.’ It was less important than
Methodism in its purely moral aspect, since it
was far less popular and practical, leaving no such profound
impression upon the religious life of the nation.
On the other hand, it exercised a more powerful influence
on Anglican theology, since it wore a more
scholarlike garb, was more attractive to cultivated and
imaginative minds, allied itself with the speculative and
historical spirit of the age, and purported to be essentially
constructive or reconstructive. It had from the
first a centre, and solid base of operations, in the University,
with branches stretching far and wide, wherever
zealous Churchmen were found. The assaults of
Methodism upon religious apathy in high places had
been more in the nature of guerilla warfare; those of
‘Tractarianism,’ as it came to be called, assumed the
character of a well-organised campaign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A reaction
against the
rising
tide of
Liberalism</div>

<p>Whatever may have been the aims of its leaders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
the Oxford Movement was in truth a reaction, and its
real origin must be sought in political rather
than in ecclesiastical causes. The question of
Catholic Emancipation, which had been stifled
at the Union, was revived in 1812 and fiercely debated
for the next seventeen years. The measure was equally
opposed by the High and Low Church parties in the
Church, but carried in 1829 by a Tory Government in
deference to political exigencies. It was followed by
the Reform Act, and in 1832 the reformed Parliament
assembled, with a large majority, not merely Erastian,
but hostile to the National Church. The vote of the
bishops on the Reform Bill had exposed them to popular
obloquy; Lord Grey himself had openly threatened them,
and the press was full of attacks on Episcopacy and the
Establishment. Lord Grey’s Act for suppressing ten
Irish bishoprics was regarded as the first outburst of
the gathering storm; timid Churchmen trembled for the
very existence of their Church, and the Oxford Movement
was set on foot with the deliberate purpose of
defending the Church and the Christianity of England
against the anti-Catholic aggressions of the dominant
Liberalism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oriel the
centre of
the Movement</div>

<p>The University of Oxford was the natural centre
for such a reaction. The constitution of the University
and colleges was semi-ecclesiastical; the Heads
were clerical dignitaries; nearly all the fellows
were bound to be in Holy Orders. Among the
colleges, Oriel then held the first rank, both as a place of
education, and as the home of a speculative and learned
society among the fellows. Copleston, its last Provost,
had been a man of remarkable capacity, and he was ably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
seconded by such colleagues as Davison and Whately.
The system of tuition at Oriel was the best in Oxford,
and as it was the first college to throw open its fellowships,
it was able to attract the ablest of the young
graduates. It was known that Oriel fellows were
selected not merely on the evidence of the class-list, or
by the results of competitive examination, but also by a
discriminating, though arbitrary, estimate of their
social qualities and probable intellectual development.
They were, therefore, a select body, somewhat inclined
to mutual admiration, producing little, but freely criticising
everything. The result was an Oriel school of
thought, commonly known as the <em>Noetics</em>, who applied
an unsparing logic to received opinions, especially those
concerning religious faith, but whose strength lay rather
in drawing inferences and refuting fallacies than in
examining and settling the premisses from which their
syllogisms were deduced. Still, Oriel fostered a bright
and independent intellectual life of its own; the Oriel
school was a standing protest against the prevailing
orthodoxy of mere conformity, and it became the congenial
head-quarters of the Oxford Movement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Henry
Newman</div>

<p>Pusey and Keble were among the fellows of Oriel,
when John Henry Newman was elected to a fellowship
in 1823, and later, in 1826, became tutor in
succession to Jelf. Newman’s early life at
Oxford was a solitary one. He did not seek friends, and
in the Oriel common-room his shy and retiring nature
sometimes concealed his real power. As Wesley’s
sympathies were originally with High Church doctrines,
so Newman’s were originally with Evangelical doctrines;
he was connected with the Evangelical set at St. Edmund<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
Hall; he was for a time secretary to the Society for
Promoting Christian Knowledge, and he actually helped
to start the ‘Record’ newspaper. In the early development
of his ideas he owed much to the robust intellect
of Whately and the accurate criticism of Hawkins, who
succeeded Copleston as Provost in 1827. But his reverence
was reserved for Keble, whose ‘Christian Year’
appeared in the same year and gave the first secret
impulse to the Movement, of which Newman became
the head. In the following year, Pusey, then little
known to Newman, returned to Oxford as Professor
of Hebrew and Canon of Christchurch, unconsciously
destined to give his own name to Newman’s followers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of
‘Tracts for
the Times’</div>

<p>At this period Newman had no intention of heading
the Oxford Movement, still less of founding a new
party in the Church. His Evangelical principles
were gradually falling away from him,
and he was girding himself up for a great struggle with
Secularism as represented by a Liberal Government, but
the first steps in the Tractarian agitation were not taken
by him. In 1832 he travelled in Italy with his friend and
pupil, Richard Hurrell Froude; and it was from him
that Newman imbibed his veneration for the Virgin and
the Saints, his antipathy to the Reformation, and his
respectful toleration of the Roman Catholic Church.
They went so far as to inquire upon what conditions
they would be allowed to communicate in that Church,
but were repelled on hearing that a subscription to the
decisions of the Council of Trent would be required.
It was during Newman’s absence abroad, in July 1833,
that Keble preached his Assize Sermon on ‘National
Apostasy,’ which may be said to have struck the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
note of the Movement, and in the same year Peter
Maurice sounded the alarm against ‘Popery in Oxford.’
A series of ‘Tracts for the Times’ was projected at a
conference, also held during Newman’s absence, by a
small body of his friends, but the plan was matured at
subsequent conferences in Oriel, where Newman was
present, and Keble warmly supported it in letters of
advice to which the utmost deference was paid. The
proposed aim of these Tracts was expository rather than
controversial; they purported to enlighten the prevailing
ignorance on Church principles and Church history.
They were to appear anonymously, and each writer
was to be responsible only for his own production. The
difficulty of maintaining this principle of limited liability
was foreseen from the first, and prudent friends
of the Movement were in favour of a judicious censorship,
but Newman was inflexible, and his will prevailed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Association
formed</div>

<p>The immediate outcome of these Oriel conferences
was the formation of an association designed to rally all
friends of the Church against the common
enemy. This was the signal for which zealous
Churchmen had been waiting, and it met with an
enthusiastic response in all parts of the country. An
address to the Archbishop of Canterbury was drawn up
and signed by eight thousand of the clergy, insisting
upon the necessity of restoring Church discipline,
maintaining Church principles, and resisting the growth
of latitudinarianism. A large section of the laity
ranged themselves on the side of the revival. Meetings
were held throughout England, and the King himself
volunteered a declaration of his strong affection for the
National Church, now roused from its apathy, and prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
to defend itself vigorously, not merely as a true
branch of the Catholic Church, but as a co-ordinate
power with the State.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Newman
assumes the
lead</div>

<p>Newman had returned from Italy deeply imbued
with the conviction that he had a definite mission to
fulfil. He was no less firmly assured of the
need for individual action at this juncture
than impelled to it by his own self-reliant nature.
While others, therefore, were urging combinations and
committees as the best methods of working, Newman’s
strong individuality revolted from joint control, especially
in the form of a ‘Committee of Revision,’ and
pressed him forward to strike the first blow for himself.
He took counsel with Froude alone, when, in the autumn
of 1833, he suddenly brought out the first of that series
of Tracts from which his party derived its familiar name
of Tractarians. In so doing he took his own colleagues
by surprise, and precipitated the crisis destined to result
from the publication of the Tracts. From that day
forth he was the recognised leader of the Tractarians.
No one among them was equally fitted for that position.
Keble was too modest and studious by disposition,
Pusey was not an original pioneer of the movement,
Froude was disqualified by delicate health. Newman
stepped naturally into the place. The influence which
he gained in his own college as a tutor, and in the
University as a preacher from the pulpit of St. Mary’s,
had drawn round him a band of followers; his sympathetic
character won the confidence of young minds;
his confessions of speculative doubt added weight to his
acceptance of dogmatic authority. Yet the secret of
his personal ascendency was never fully revealed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
himself, nor did he ever fully realise the impression produced
by his sermons. To him the Tractarian Movement
was ‘no movement, but the spirit of the times.’
He felt himself, not the leader of a new party, but a
loyal son of the old Church; now awakened from her
lethargy. He claimed no allegiance and issued no commands.
It was through friends and disciples, as we
learn from himself, that his principles were spread, and,
as in the case of Socrates, their reports of his conversations
were perhaps the main source of the spell which
he exercised over the University and the Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spread and
objects of
the movement.
Publication
of
Tract XC.</div>

<p>The adhesion of Pusey in 1835 was a great accession
of strength to the Tractarians. He had contributed a
Tract to the series in December 1833, but he
did not formally join the Movement until a
year and a half later. His learning, social
connections, and official position gave it a
certain dignity and solidity in which it had been lacking.
Recruits now offered themselves in abundance,
and gifted young men spent their days and nights in
poring over materials for the Library of the Fathers
originated by Pusey, or in journeying from place to
place, in the spirit of the Methodist Revivalists, though
in the pursuit of a very different ideal. But the influence
of Tractarianism over Oxford thought must not
be exaggerated. While it fascinated many subtle and
imaginative minds of a high order, and gathered into
itself much of the spiritual and even of the intellectual
life of the University, there were many robust intellects
and earnest hearts which it not only failed to reach but
stirred into hostility. If it would be easy to draw up an
imposing list of eminent Oxford men who became Tractarians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
it would not be less easy to enumerate an equal
number of equally eminent men who consistently opposed
Tractarianism, and predicted that it must lead to Romanism.
Nothing was further from the original intentions
and expectations of Newman himself. His object was to
revive the usages and doctrines of the primitive Church;
to co-operate, indeed, with the Church of Rome, so far as
possible, but to keep aloof from its pernicious corruptions;
to establish the catholicity of the Anglican
Church, but, above all, to hold the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via media</i> laid down
by its founders. His faith in Anglicanism was first
disturbed in the Long Vacation of 1839 by his supposed
discovery of a decisive analogy between the position of
the Monophysite heretics and that of the Anglican communion.
Still, though he was gradually assimilating
the doctrines, he rebelled against the abuses and excesses,
of the Roman Church. Anglicanism as a distinctive
creed had become untenable to him, but he
clung to a hope that its title might be lineally deduced
from the primitive Church, instead of being founded on
a secession from the Church of Rome. It was in this
frame of mind that he published Tract XC. in the year
1841, for the purpose of showing that the Articles of
the English Church were directed, not against the
doctrines of the Church of Rome as interpreted by the
Council of Trent, but against earlier heresies disavowed
by that Council.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Collapse of
Tractarianism,
and
secession of
Newman</div>

<p>This Tract brought the Movement to a climax. It
was received with a storm of indignation throughout
the country. The bishops delivered charges against it,
the great mass of Churchmen regarded it as an attack
on the Protestant Establishment, and a direct invitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
to Romanism. The Bishop of Oxford intervened, and
the farther issue of Tracts was stopped. Henceforth the
real tendency of Tractarianism was disclosed,
and its promoters were hopelessly discredited.
Newman found, to his own great surprise, that
his power was shattered. He retired, during Lent 1840,
to his parish at Littlemore, entrusting St. Mary’s to a
curate, in view of his possible resignation. His loyalty
to the English Church wavered more and more as he
renewed his study of the Arian controversy, and his
misgivings were intensified by the hostile attitude of
the bishops, as well as by an incident which to a
secular mind would have appeared trivial—the institution
of the Jerusalem bishopric on a semi-Anglican
and semi-Lutheran basis. His resignation of St. Mary’s
in the autumn of 1843, two years after the publication
of Tract XC., was due to an impulse of despondency
on failing to dissuade a young friend from conversion
to Romanism. After preaching his last sermon there
he retired into lay-communion, giving up all idea of
acting upon others, and turning all his thoughts inwards.
Two years later, on October 8, 1845, his remaining
difficulties being removed, he was himself
received into the Church of Rome, and finally left
Oxford early in the following year. Though his defection
had long been foreseen, it caused a profound shock
throughout the English Church. The first panic was succeeded
by a reaction; some devoted adherents followed
him to Rome; others relapsed into lifeless conformity;
and the University soon resumed its wonted tranquillity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
‘Hampden
Controversy’</div>

<p>The ‘Hampden Controversy,’ in 1836, may be regarded
as an episode of the Tractarian revival, already in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
full course of development. This controversy arose out
of Dr. Hampden’s Bampton Lectures on Scholastic
Philosophy, delivered in 1882, which, however,
had attracted little attention until he was
appointed Regius Professor of Divinity four
years later. No sooner was this appointment known,
than an anti-Hampden Committee was formed, of
which Pusey and Newman were members. The
Crown was actually petitioned to recall its nomination,
but this petition was coldly rejected by Lord
Melbourne, and a vote of censure on Dr. Hampden,
proposed by the Hebdomadal Board, was defeated
in Convocation by the Proctors’ joint-veto—a very
unusual, but perfectly constitutional, exercise of the
Proctorial authority. A war of pamphlets ensued, and
the vote of censure being reintroduced, after a change
of Proctors, was carried by an overwhelming majority.
According to the opinion of eminent counsel, the proceeding
was illegal, as transgressing the jurisdiction of
the University under the Charter of 1636, but the sentence
was never reversed, and Dr. Hampden remained
under the ban of the University, excluded from various
privileges of his office, until his elevation to the See
of Hereford in 1847. The opposition to him then
broke out afresh, and the Dean of Hereford, in a letter
to Lord John Russell, held out a threat of resistance
to the Royal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">congé d’élire</i>. The answer of Lord John
Russell was such as might be expected, but thirteen
bishops supported the Dean’s protest by a remonstrance,
which Lord John Russell met by a peremptory refusal
to make the prerogative of the Crown dependent on
the caprice of a chance majority at one University,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
largely composed of persons who had since joined the
Church of Rome. Nevertheless, a final attempt was
made to negative the ‘confirmation’ of Dr. Hampden’s
appointment at Bow Church. An argument on this
point in the Court of Queen’s Bench ended in a dismissal
of the case, owing to differences of opinion among
the judges, and on March 25, 1848, Dr. Hampden was
duly consecrated Bishop.</p>

<p>On the other hand, while Newman was in retirement
at Littlemore, Pusey was suspended from preaching
in the University pulpit for two years, on
a report from a board appointed to examine a
sermon delivered by him at Christ Church, in
which he was alleged to have affirmed the Real Presence
in a sense inconsistent with the doctrines of the Church.
Soon afterwards, Dr. Hampden, as Regius Professor of
Divinity, inhibited from his B.D. degree a candidate
who had declined to be examined by him on Tradition
and Transubstantiation. The right of examination was
challenged by the candidate, but upheld by the Delegates
of Appeals, to whom the question was referred.
On November 20, 1844, Mr. Ward, a fellow of Balliol, was
summoned before the Vice-Chancellor, and questioned
respecting the authorship of a book entitled ‘The Ideal
of a Christian Church.’ A war of pamphlets ensued,
but in the end, on February 13, 1845, a proposition was
submitted to Convocation, densely crowded with non-residents,
condemning Ward’s doctrines as inconsistent
with the Articles, with his subscription thereto, and
with his own good faith in subscribing. This resolution
was carried by a large majority, and a further
resolution, for the degradation of Ward, was carried by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
a smaller majority. A third resolution, condemning
Tract XC., had been appended, but was negatived by
the joint veto of the Proctors. It had actually been
intended to subjoin to the first resolution a declaration
annexing a new sense to subscription, and thus creating
a new test, but this addition was ultimately withdrawn
in deference to a legal opinion, which also denied the
validity of Ward’s deprivation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of the
‘Oxford
Movement’</div>

<p>With these proceedings the academical history of
the Tractarian Movement may properly be closed,
though many distinguished members of the
University joined the Church of Rome at a
later period, especially after the celebrated
judgment in the ‘Gorham Case,’ establishing liberty of
opinion on Baptismal Regeneration. For several years
after Newman’s conversion, the progress of the Neo-Catholic
Revival was arrested, and when it took a new
departure under the name of Ritualism, it ceased to
draw its inspiration from the University of Oxford.
Nevertheless, the work of Newman and his fellows left
its mark on the University as well as on the English
Church. The effect of his speculative teaching was
infinitely weakened by his own conversion to Rome, but
the effect of his practical teaching could not be dissipated.
In the widespread restoration of churches, in
the improvement of church-services, and in the greater
energy of religious life within the Anglican communion,
we may still recognise the influence for good which
emanated from the Oriel common-room.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Controversy
on the
Endowment
of the
Greek
Professorship.
Defeat of
Mr. Gladstone
in
1865</div>

<p>Thirty years after his own suspension, Dr. Pusey,
now regarded as a champion of orthodoxy, came forward
with certain other Doctors of Divinity, to bring a charge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
of heresy against Mr. Jowett, of Balliol, the Regius Professor
of Greek, who had contributed to the volume
called ‘Essays and Reviews.’ A suit was instituted
in the Chancellor’s Court, and on
February 6, 1863, a judgment was delivered by
Mr. Mountague Bernard, as assessor. This
judgment disallowed the defendant’s protest
against the jurisdiction of the Court in spiritual
matters, or over a Regius Professor; but, in effect,
arrested the proceedings without deciding the case
on its merits. A somewhat undignified controversy
followed, and greatly disturbed the peace of the University,
on the question of increasing the very meagre
endowment of the Greek Professorship—a measure
which Dr. Pusey opposed on the sole ground that it would
strengthen the position of the existing Professor. The
partisanship engendered by the long struggle on this
question divided the senior members of the University
into hostile camps, and often determined their votes on
matters which had no connection with the subject. At
last, on February 18, 1865, a compromise was effected, by
accepting the offer of Christchurch to endow the Professorship.
The University, in truth, was heartily sick
of the controversy, and even the High Church residents
were unwilling to please the non-resident clergy by
perpetuating an apparent injustice which damaged
their own credit with the abler students. In the following
summer, Mr. Gladstone, who had been elected
Member of Parliament for the University in 1847, and
whose seat had been contested at every subsequent
election, was defeated by Mr. Gathorne Hardy. This
event established the supremacy of the Conservative
party in the constituency, and, though a contest took
place in 1878, the result was never doubtful, and the
fierce passions incident to constant trials of political
strength have sensibly died away. Thus, two fruitful
sources of academical discord were removed within a
few months of each other. The last twenty-one years
have witnessed many warm discussions and close divisions
in the University legislature, but they have been
mainly on academical issues, and have seldom been
embittered by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">odium theologicum</i>. Since 1865, a
tacit <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">concordat</i> has prevailed between the two great
schools of thought in Oxford, and a philosophical
toleration of opinion has superseded the intolerant
dogmatism, not confined to one party in the Church,
which had its origin in the Neo-Catholic Revival.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE UNIVERSITY IN 1886</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Reign of
Queen
Victoria</div>

<p class="no-indent">The last chapter of University history covers a period
within living memory, and practically coextensive with
the reign of Queen Victoria. Its main interest
consists in the rapid succession of theological
controversies which have agitated the academical mind,
and in the series of internal reforms dating from
1850. Both of these subjects have been separately
considered, but it still remains to review briefly the
strange transformation wrought in the various aspects
of University life within the lifetime of the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
generation, not so much by external interference as by
the natural growth of new social conditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">State of the
University
on the
Queen’s
accession</div>

<p>On the accession of Queen Victoria the college-system
was already established on its present basis, and
effective University examinations had put an
end to the licensed idleness of the eighteenth
century. But the University and the colleges
were still governed respectively by antiquated codes of
statutes, which it would have been no less disastrous than
impossible to enforce strictly, but from which, as we have
seen, it required the intervention of the Legislature to
release them. Though a considerable number of able
students destined for the Bar were attracted by scholarships
and the prospect of fellowships, Oxford was still
mainly a clerical and aristocratic seminary, exercising a
very slight influence on the scientific or commercial world,
and little affected by their fashions. Until it was connected
with the metropolis by railway, it retained the
distinctive character of a provincial town, and many
eccentric recluses of a type now obsolete were still to be
found in college rooms, who had never entered a London
club or drawing-room. The whole authority of the University
was, in fact, exerted to keep the railway at a distance,
and the Oxford branch was not opened before June
12, 1844. Though Oxford was much frequented by visitors
in the summer term, not without injury to continuity
of study, its atmosphere was still essentially academical,
if not scholastic, and the conversation as well as the
social tone of its residents, both graduates and undergraduates,
differed sensibly from those of their contemporaries
in the metropolis and elsewhere. Oxford
Dons had not altogether lost the traditional characteristics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
of their class; the model Oxford first-class man,
assuming to have mastered classical literature, Greek
philosophy, and ancient history, which he regarded as
the staple of human knowledge, was accused of exhibiting
the pride of intellect in its purest form; young
priests of the new ‘Oxford School’ assuredly carried
sacerdotal presumption to its logical extreme; and the
chartered libertinism of ‘fast men’ in one or two Oxford
colleges sometimes brought scandal on the whole
University. No doubt the habits of Oxford ‘collegians’
fifty years ago would have compared favourably with
those of their grandfathers, still more with those of the
squalid but industrious students who begged their way
to the University in the Middle Ages. Nevertheless,
hard drinking and its concomitant vices were by no means
obsolete, even in common-rooms, and though undergraduates
cultivated the manners of young gentlemen,
their ordinary moral code was probably but little above
that which then prevailed in the army and the navy.
Side by side, however, with the self-indulgent circles of
undergraduate society, there was a limited set deeply
impressed by the ascetic teaching of the Neo-Catholic
school, whose practical influence on its disciples resembled
in many respects that of the Evangelical school
at Cambridge, however different in its theological basis.
The prevailing narrowness and intensity of theological
opinion was perhaps favoured by the narrowness of the
University curriculum. Classics and mathematics retained
a monopoly of studies; few wasted time on
modern languages, history, or natural science; while
music and art in all its aspects were regarded by most
as feminine accomplishments. Since professors were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
very scarce, and tutors (being fellows) were unable to
marry, family life and social intercourse with ladies had
no place in an University career. The members of each
college associated comparatively little with ‘out-college
men,’ in the absence of clubs, debating societies, and
other bonds of non-collegiate union. Rowing and
cricket were vigorously cultivated by young men from
the great public schools, and hunting was carried on,
especially by noblemen and gentlemen-commoners,
with a lordly disregard of economy; but for the mass of
students there was no great choice of games and recreations,
at least in the winter. Those who did not aspire
to Honours, being the great majority, had no occasion to
read hard, and often lived for amusement only, since
there was an interval of full two years between Responsions
and ‘the Schools,’ unbroken by any examination.
Those who read for Honours generally read with a
steadiness and singleness of purpose incompatible with
much attention to any other pursuit. Various as these
elements were, they were readily assimilated by the
University, which seldom failed to leave a distinctive
stamp upon one who had passed through it, and Oxford
culture retained a peculiar flavour of its own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of
recent
changes</div>

<p>In the course of the last fifty years, a profound
though almost unseen change has gradually passed over
the face of the old University. The introduction
of representative government into the
academical constitution has not only cleared away
many abuses, but has at once popularised and centralised
University administration. The recognition of Unattached
Students has broken down the monopoly of
colleges; the abolition of close fellowships has infused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
new blood and new ideas into the more backward
collegiate bodies; the spontaneous development of
numerous clubs and associations—athletic, literary, or
political—has created many new ties among undergraduates,
and weakened the old exclusive spirit of
college partisanship. The ‘Combined Lecture System,’
under which the inmates of one college may receive instruction
in another, has also favoured a division of
labour among tutors which is directly conducive to
specialism in teaching. The great extension of the
professoriate, including the new order of University
Readers, and still more the liberal encouragement of new
studies, has infinitely expanded the intellectual interests
both of teachers and of students; the admission of Nonconformists
and the progress of free thought have powerfully
modified theological bigotry; the multiplication of
feminine influences has undermined the ideal of semi-monastic
seclusion, and greatly increased the innocent
æsthetic distractions which are the most formidable
rivals of the austerer Muses. The gulf between Oxford
society and the great world outside, never very impassable,
has been effectually bridged over in every direction.
A very large proportion of professors and college tutors
have travelled widely; many are well known in London
as contributors to scientific and literary periodicals or
otherwise; while Oxford itself is constantly thronged
with visitors from the metropolis. In ceasing to be
clerical and aristocratic, the University has become far
more cosmopolitan; all religions are there mingled
harmoniously, nor is it uncommon to meet in the streets
young men of Oriental race and complexion wearing
academical costume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Present
character
of the University</div>

<p>In the meantime, a marked and widespread reformation
has been wrought in the morals of the University,
and notwithstanding the influx of a large plebeian
element, the manners of undergraduates
have become gentler as their tastes have become
more refined. The ostentation of wealth has been
visibly diminished, and, notwithstanding the increase of
amusements, there is probably more of plain living and
high thinking in modern Oxford than in the Oxford of
Charles II. or Elizabeth. The University, it is true,
has yet to harmonise many conflicting elements, which
mar the symmetry of its constitution; but it is becoming
more and more identified with the highest intellectual
aspirations of the nation as a whole. In ceasing
to be the intellectual stronghold of the mediæval Church,
or the instrument of Tudor statecraft, or the chosen
training-school for the Anglican clergy, it may have
lost something of its ancient supremacy, but it has
asserted its national character; and it has perhaps
never exercised a more widespread control over the
national mind than it possesses in these latter years
of the nineteenth century.</p>
